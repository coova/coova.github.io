CoovaChilli is an open-source software access controller, based on the popular, but now defunct, ChilliSpot project, and is actively maintained by an original ChilliSpot contributor. 

Released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 

CoovaChilli is a feature rich software access controller that provides a captive portal / walled-garden environment and uses RADIUS or a HTTP protocol for access provisioning and accounting. CoovaChilli is an integral part of the CoovaAP OpenWRT-based firmware which is specialized for hotspots. For more information on how Coova's Chilli differs from the standard ChilliSpot, be sure to see the ChangeLog.
