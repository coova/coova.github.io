CoovaChilli is an open-source software access controller, based on the
popular, but now defunct, ChilliSpot project, and is actively maintained by an
original ChilliSpot contributor.

Released under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) (GPL). 

CoovaChilli is a feature rich software access controller that provides a captive
portal / walled-garden environment and uses RADIUS or a HTTP protocol for access
provisioning and accounting. CoovaChilli is an integral part of the CoovaAP
OpenWRT-based firmware which is specialized for hotspots. For more information
on how Coova's Chilli differs from the standard ChilliSpot, be sure to see the
ChangeLog.
