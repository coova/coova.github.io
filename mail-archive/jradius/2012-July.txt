Hello,

That is correct. The JRadius project is an LGPL RADIUS stack in Java
that on the server side works as a module (through rlm_jradius) to
FreeRADIUS. You can then implement your business/RADIUS logic in Java,
while FreeRADIUS does all the heavy lifting as the front-end RADIUS
server. For something more 'complete' and pure Java, Coova has
CoovaRADIUS, which is itself a RADIUS server, and has more in terms of
features specific to hotspot networks and can be used to manage users
and access policies. 

I hope this addresses your questions.

Best regards,
David
