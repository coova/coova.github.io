Subject: [Jradius] Need help on implementing a RADIUS client on Android
Message-ID: <CAMvCkUE_2xtwZKp-SRLqPfWB-p6Xyufm0pdp4DPniJFEmvPffw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am working on a project which I need to write a RADIUS client on the
Android platform and I am considering to use JRadius.  After doing some
research, I have found that JRadius client requires to use java.beans, and
java.beans and its dependencies are not available.  Therefore, I want to
ask if there is any workaround for that? If not, can anyone suggest another
framework?  I'd greatly appreciate any advice or pointers that you could
pass along.

Stephen
