Subject: [Jradius] Licensing issues (GPL vs. LGPL) - need clarification

Hi,

I'm currently evaluating jradius regarding usability in a commercial
closed source project (only client functionality is required e.g.
authenticate against some 3rdparty radius-server). LGPL would be ok for
that, but GPL is certainly not.

I'm referring to the source in your SVN trunk:

The LICENCE file states, that only certain explicitely listed
applications are released under GPL while the general core is released
under LGPL.

HOWEVER:

I usually grep for GPL headers in the source and in this case, I found
several source files with GPL headers in core/. The following files
contain GPL headers:

core/src/main/java/net/jradius/realm/JRadiusRealmManager.java
core/src/main/java/net/jradius/realm/JRadiusRealm.java
core/src/main/java/net/jradius/realm/RadiusRealm.java
core/src/main/java/net/jradius/server/ListenerRequest.java
core/src/main/java/net/jradius/server/TCPListenerRequest.java
core/src/main/java/net/jradius/freeradius/RadiusDictionary.java

Unfortunately, those are so deeply woven into the rest of the core code,
that even if we use only client functionality, some GPL code would be
used unconditionally - rendering the whole core unacceptable for
commerial use.

So, my question is: Are those files perhaps GPLd by mistake or are they
really not LPGL code?

Please clarify.

Thanks in advance
 -Fritz
