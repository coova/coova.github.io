Subject: RadSec
Message-ID: <1251191594.8114.14.camel@david-laptop>

Hello all,

I've implemented a first version of RadSec support in JRadius, an
open-source Java client and server framework. Details are at:

http://www.coova.org/JRadius/RadSec

Highlights:
- Uses standard JCE and also Bouncy Castle.
- Uses standard Java KeyManager and TrustManager.
- RadSec support in general RadiusClient.
- RadSec support in JRadiusSimulator for testing!
- RadSec support in JRadius server with a simple proxy handler provided.

This is all new to JRadius, and is only in the subversion version. To
make it easier, here is a snapshot build of the current full release:

http://dev.coova.org/jradius/jradius-svn-116.zip

If interested only in using the simulator/client GUI, you can launch
on-line at:

http://dev.coova.org/jnlp/JRadiusSimulator.jnlp

(note: webstart will download the java jars once (unless updated), the
initial download is rather large because of the jradius-dictionary).

Enjoy,
David

Subject: Question about port 1812
Message-ID: <ca5a3f590908310321pb3d977ehdf8d6a6dd62da709@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm new on JRadius and my knowledge on RADIUS and FreeRadius is very limited
as well. My question is about the use of port 1812 by FreeRadius and by the
JRadius.

1. In the FreeRadius log file we can see that it uses the port 1812 for
authentication:*
"Listening on authentication *:1812"*

2. In the JRadius configuration file(jradius-config.xml) we can see that
this port is also used by the the GenericWebServices listener:
*        <listener name="GenericWebSerices">
            <description>JRadius WebServices Listener</description>
            <class>net.sf.jradius.webservice.WebServiceListener</class>

<processor-class>net.sf.jradius.webservice.WebServiceProcessor</processor-class>
            <processor-threads>2</processor-threads>
            <property name="port" value="1812"/>
            <property name="backlog" value="1024"/>
            <property name="useSSL" value="false"/>
            <packet-handler name="SSOProxy">
                <description>SSO Proxy Redirector</description>
                <class>net.sf.jradius.webservice.SSOProxyService</class>
            </packet-handler>
        </listener>*

Could this situation cause any sort of conflict? both applications are
trying to use the same port to listen for requests?
