Subject: New mailing list for JRadius
Message-ID: <7D475C59-C5F9-43F3-AD1E-D4FAE11FFC04@mac.com>

Hello,

I created a mailing list for JRadius and seeded it with those who  
have registered at the old jradius.org forum. You can, of course,  
remove yourself from the list by sending an e-mail to:

	 jradius-unsubscribe at coova.org

I suspect this list will remain rather low volume. I will  
periodically send out announcements of new features and svn commits.  
You are also welcome to ask questions or give suggestions to the list  
(or to the forum).

Cheers!
David
