Yes, works fine with a Mac - even with a new implementation of the  
jradius eap-tls class using bouncy castle TLS instead of the native  
java SSLEngine.

Subject: version 0.45 released

Hello,

A new version of jradius was released today, svn version 0.45.

http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/JRadius

Most notably is the addition of the bouncy castle crypto jar and the  
PEAP authenticator that is based on it. The JRadius Simulator has  
also been updated for WebStart.
