Subject: [Jradius] JRadius Proxy mangles User-Password
Message-ID: <AANLkTimXb1g=uXHP7kGxc-bJS_U2Eq-Zr4QmGpCzdZ5J@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm trying to set up JRadius to accept Radsec connections and proxy them
onto freeradius.

I've set up jardius as described on coova.org, and it seems to work well,
except the User-Password is encrypted by the time it reaches freeradius

I get the following reported on the freeradius side:

    User-Name = "testuser"
    User-Password =
"\212\230\306\310\313}\010\231\257\211F\237.l\365JJ\2173\240b\367\215+?u\177=\237\304\001"

My NAS is sending plaintext passwords so I'm pretty sure Jradius is mangling
the User-Password somehow.

Does anyone know why this would be happening and how to prevent it?

I did notice "dictionary.rfc2865" had a line:
User-Password                2    string encrypt=1
but setting encrypt=0 dosn't seem to make a difference.

Thanks,
Murray

Hello,

The User-Password is always encoded ("encrypted") with the shared secret
on the wire. Changes are that there is a shared secret mix up
somewhere.

Oh interesting, so it's only the password field that gets hashed by shared
secret?

At the moment I have:
UAM --(radsec) --> Jradius ---(radius)--> freeradius

I defiantly got the same secret between Jradius and freeradius ( set in
radSecProxyHander.sharedSecret )
But I haven't told Jradius about the shared secret being used by the UAM,
and I'm not sure where to set this.  Can someone point me in the right
direction?

Thanks Murray

Hi Folks

I've been trying for some time now to marry CoovaChilli and RadSecProxy.
We've also managed to uncover some serious design flaws with the
implementation of RadSec by RadSecProxy.

You can read the discussion here -> http://bit.ly/czEpxt

It's become apparent that JRadius may be another options for RadSec
implementation, and in our case
we would use it to handle ONLY the RadSec protocol and forward to our
FreeRadius server.

I have a few question that maybe someone in the community could answer:

   1. Is anyone actually using JRadius with RadSec? If so, how many routers
   to you have connected and is it scalable?
   2. Does JRadius thread each incoming connection and keep the connection
   alive for the duration of the CoovaChilli runtime?
   3. How many open sockets can it handle? Linux default is 1024, or it
   this irrelevant?

Hi David, Jradius LIst,

After further testing I'm doubting this is a shared secret problem:

If I intentionally send the wrong shared secret from client-->Jradius,
Jradius gives me and error saying:
"Bad RadSec tunnel shared secret, set to radsec"

If I intentionally set the wrong shared secret for the Jradius-->freeradius
connection, freeradius gives me an error saying:
"Received packet from 127.0.0.1 with invalid Message-Authenticator!  (Shared
secret is incorrect.) Dropping packet without response."

If I use the correct shared secrets on both sides, I get no error messages,
only garbled passwords.

Is there any way to get Jradius to log packets before it proxys them? So I
can at least isolate the problem to the client-->jradius connection or the
jradius-->freeradius one.

Many Thanks,
Murray

The shared secret from CoovaChilli(UAM) to JRadius should be "radsec"

Yes, I am using "radsec" as the shared secret between UAM and Jradius

The thing is, if I intentionally set an incorrect shared secret on either
side I get an appropriate error message.  Where as if I use the correct
secrets I get no error messages only mangled passwords.

Is it possible there is something wrong with the shared secret that is not
being picked up by the error checking?
