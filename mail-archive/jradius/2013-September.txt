Subject: [Jradius] jRadius Maven repository not working?
Message-ID: <D6C6AEF4F549CD488B099EA28CCE17310EA456EC@xmb-rcd-x11.cisco.com>

 I am trying to use the repository at http://coova-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/mvn/ but just get "access denied" or "forbidden".  This happens whether I try to proxy to it from a Nexus repository, or whether I just put this URL in a browser.

I consulted with a colleague who has been proxying the Coova jRadius Maven repository successfully from his Nexus server.  He checked and he is seeing the same thing.

So I conclude something has changed on the Coova server side.  Can someone help resolve this?  Thanks.
