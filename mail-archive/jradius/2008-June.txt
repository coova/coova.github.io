Subject: rlm_jradius error: Unresponsive child in module...
Message-ID: <4844B0E3.8020409@nowirz.com>

Hello all,

I've been encountering an error in our jRADIUS logs that I cannot seem 
to pin down:

...
Mon Jun  2 22:18:38 2008 : Error: WARNING: Unresponsive child (id 2989710224) for request 28653, in module jradius component accounting
Mon Jun  2 22:18:38 2008 : Error: WARNING: Unresponsive child (id 2939378576) for request 28652, in module jradius component accounting
Mon Jun  2 22:18:38 2008 : Error: WARNING: Unresponsive child (id 2905824144) for request 28651, in module jradius component accounting
Mon Jun  2 22:18:38 2008 : Error: WARNING: Unresponsive child (id 2863881104) for request 28650, in module jradius component accounting
Mon Jun  2 22:18:38 2008 : Error: WARNING: Unresponsive child (id 2889046928) for request 28649, in module jradius component accounting
...


It happens when some of our busier access controllers (frustratingly) 
flood the server with 25+ accounting requests in a very short interval.  
Given the conditions, I'm assuming the error indicates some sort of 
timeout in communication between rlm_jradius and the actual jRADIUS 
server.  Assuming this is a timeout-related error, what is an acceptable 
processing time?  Could this be caused by anything else?

As always, your help is greatly appreciated!

John
