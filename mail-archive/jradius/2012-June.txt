Hi,

I am new to the JRadius forum but have used freeradius+chilli for some time.
I am planning to move an educational trust's current setup of
freeradius+chillispot to coovachilli + jradius.

I gather that JRadius is just a pluggable entity that interacts with
freeradius at certain points and not a full-blown java based radius server.
I would still have to depend on freeradius for the core part and the
management user interface.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

I am also looking for a java based front-end to manage the radius
implementation and create post-paid/pre-paid accounts, users, plans etc; Is
something there or should we continue with the PHP based freeradius UI.

Thanks,
~Vikas
