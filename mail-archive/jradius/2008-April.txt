Hi,

There have been commits to svn, and a development snapshot is  
available here:

	http://coova.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=707

Note! the format of data going between rlm_jradius and JRadius server  
has changed! Two fields went from a byte to 4 bytes. Use that part of  
JRadius with caution. In this binary distro, is a version of CoovaEWT  
and example interface for configuring FreeRADIUS and it's SQL  
database tables.

Best regards,
david
