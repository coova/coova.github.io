Subject: Setting up a build environment
Message-ID: <20090105014304.GT9548@melon.org>

Hi there,

Someone's asked me to set up an openwrt/coova build environment for them,
and I'm having some problems. I've grabbed the appropriate revision of
OpenWRT (whiterussian r9287, from the OpenWRT SVN repository), and the
patchfiles from the coova repository, but the files referenced in 
svn-rev-9287.patch (from the coova repository) aren't there.

I've checked with find $whiterussiandir -name $basename for the files,
tried configuring and building OpenWRT first to see if that creates the
files, and I've also looked at r9287 of kamikaze in case there was some
sort of versioning error. None of this has been fruitful.

So I'm wondering if there are some sort of additional packages that I
need to get and install in the OpenWRT tree before applying the Coova
patches, or some other version of OpenWRT that I'm supposed to be using
(e.g. r9287 from some other repository), ore more generally, what am I
supposed to to in order to get an OpenWRT that the whiterussian patch
can actually be applied to.

Thanks,
Kris
