Hi,

It looks like CoovaAP is based on the OpenWRT WhiteRussian release,
while OpenWRT Kamikaze is the current release.  Is this correct?

If yes, are there plans to bring out a new (Kamikaze-based) version
of CoovaAP?

Hi,

Yes, there are plans... and work continues toward it. Kamikaze is  
maturing and getting closer to supporting all the necessary features.  
CoovaAP (version 2, as I'll probably call it) will also have a  
completely new web interface... based on CoovaEWT.

Cheers,
David

Hi,

When using CoovaAP (1.0 beta.7d), should the Hotspot / Hotspot DHCP
configuration include addresses that are part the configured LAN
network?  Should the wireless interface together with the LAN
interfaces be seen as one bridged network?

Just for my understanding, what would be a typical config example for
LAN/WAN/wireless addresses?  The device doesn't seem to route now
(with my config, that is probably wrong).

As a background:
With the original Linksys firmware I had made a setup that has one
10.x.x.x netwerk on both the LAN and the wireless interface, with
one cable in LAN1 to a separate (masquerading) firewall.  I didn't
use the WAN interface.  In principe, a similar setup for CoovaAP
would be fine (but with a captive portal for wireless users).

Any help is appreciated.

To answer my own question:

I found out that this requires the option that allows wireless access
to the LAN to be set, which sounds reasonable in this case ;-).
