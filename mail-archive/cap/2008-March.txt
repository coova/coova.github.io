Subject: WISPr firefox extension!
Message-ID: <F75F0183-4845-4BBA-8D7E-D37A21A4A11C@mac.com>

New, actually useful, hotspot tools from the "Labs" :)

It is a Firefox extension taking advantage of the simple WISPr client  
found in JRadius. I have tested it with both CoovaAP/Chilli and  
Colubris access controllers, but it should work with just about any  
WISPr implementation.

Check it out!
