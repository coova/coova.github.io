It's now in the Applications directory:

Give it a try! It's actually really nice - I'm using it as my default  
at home.

Cheers,

Hello,

I went ahead and released coova-chilli 1.0.10 as it has important  
fixes concerning DHCP relay and a couple other issues. Also, there is  
a CoovaAP 1.0-beta.7c out - sorry for the rapid releases, but there  
were a couple bugs in CoovaAP which needed immediate attention. The  
newest chilli is in the updated CoovaAP release. If you have an  
earlier version of 1.0-beta.7 and have problems, you should upgrade.

Thanks,
David

Hi all,

Shoot! I found a stupid bug in the latest version of chilli - making  
RADIUS VSAs sent my chilli a bit mangled.

My sincere apologies. And, yes, I should be releasing pre-releases  
instead of upping the version number so quickly. But, I have found  
not many people bother to test until it is released. Perhaps that  
will change soon as the community is growing and more people are  
testing out the svn version as it gets worked on.

Anyways, I am looking to correct the problem by releasing 1.0.11 (and  
CoovaAP 1.0-beta.7d) -- any other issues found in 1.0.10, let me know  
today!

Thanks,
David
