Hello,

Yes, I've been hearing from many that they would like to see CoovaAP
come out with a new release. The question has always been, maintain the
Whiterussian version or finally move on to Kamikaze? If kamikaze, what
'flavor' as several projects already "maintain" configuration syntax for
chilli - x-wrt, Open-mesh, etc. Indeed, the open-mesh/ROBIN project
might prove to be a good foundation to take advantage of all OpenWrt and
Mesh have to offer. In the absence of the nvram variables, the ROBIN
project is establishing a protocol for maintaining router firmware and
configuration. It seems natural to do something similar for CAP.

Subject: secondary radius via AP
Message-ID: <4774.85.105.98.159.1239394445.squirrel@webmail.bilkent.edu.tr>

hello,
It seems if we add a secondary radius server to coova configuration, it
just ignores it.

It there any patch to fix this error?
?t seems the problem is about hs_radius.sh page.. Because when we add
smthing and click save..it even doesnt save it at all.
