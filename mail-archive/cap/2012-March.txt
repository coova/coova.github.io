Subject: [Cap] "Username already taken" error when using self registration
Message-ID: <0ED82BB99A64491C9C81288C675A5F8A@nova9.net>

Hi list,  

I searched the web (including the CoovaAP Firmware forum) for a solution for my problem but I could?t find a solution or workaround for my problem. I noticed that some users seem to have the same problem as I do.

I get a "Username already taken. Choose another one. []" when I try to register a new user using the self registration page. Does anybody have a solution for this problem? Oh yes ? I use the latest Firmware on a WRT54GL V1.1.

Any help will be appreciated

Thank you
