Hi,

I found this e-mail address on the CoovaAP page. And I am writing to ask for
your help.
I need to implement CoovaAP on my ASUS WL500G Premium, but I cannot find the
firmware for this device. Could you share your source code to me? Or could
you send me a compiled firmware for WL500GP?

Thanks a lot!

Regards,
Ke Huang
