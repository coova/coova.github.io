Subject: subnet error
Message-ID: <43036.139.179.14.250.1221824413.squirrel@webmail.bilkent.edu.tr>

Hello,
We tried to divide a subnet into two while installing CoovaAP.
We set the wan ip 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.128 and lan
192.168.1.129/255.255.255.128
Normal what we expect was to distribute the IPs starting from
192.168.1.130..but
it calculates it wrong and starts distributing the ip from 192.168.1.1
So the client gets ip 192.168.1.1(for ex) with subnet 255.255.255.128 but
the gateway seems 192.168.1.129.
I think it is a bug or wrong calculation  of coova config creator.
Because it works when we set it manually on config files.

And i do wonder when will we have an updated AP image with the latest
coova software on it..
