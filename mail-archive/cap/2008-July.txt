Subject: CoovaAP: internal hotspot vs. ChilliSpot UAM
Message-ID: <200807160927.m6G9RCok020450@jasmine.xos.nl>

Hi,

CoovaAP using the internal hotspot works fine for me.

But instead of localhost.ap.coova.org I want to see an own hostname
in the URL.  At first sight I then have to change the HotSpot type
from "Internal HotSpot" to "ChilliSpot UAM".  But then I don't
manage to get the rest of the settings right, so that it behaves
the same as the internal one.

The splash page is ok, the URL of the login page I get looks correct:

   http://hotspot.mydomain.net:3442/www/login.chi?res=...

I have added hotspot.mydomain.net to /etc/hosts with the same IP
address as localhost.ap.coova.org.  But the login page just gives
me a complete blank page, without an error message.

Can someone give me some hints to solve this problem?

Thanks,
