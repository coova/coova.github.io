Hmm... yes, I know the current CoovaAP release has some issues... I have
been focused more on chilli recently :)

The story is that CoovaAP 1.0-beta.5, trying to resolve some stability
issues, uses a non-standard OpenWRT whiterussian patch (sourced from the
OpenWrt forum on the stability issue). This actually has been reported to
fix the stability issue, but introduced a bunch of other problems. What the
patch did was to bring some kamikaze drivers into whiterussian. It also made
it impossible to upgrade the firmware using a .bin file (a change to mtd in
kamikaze). You should be able to use the .trx file just fine or tftp a .bin.
I perhaps rushed too quickly into releasing that version of CoovaAP.

The best solution would be to finally get CoovaAP on kamikaze instead of
spending time fixing whiterussian. But, this also has its issues. For one, I
wanted to roll out a new web admin interface when porting to kamikaze.
However, this still requires some work. The next release needs to be a major
one, with cleaner packaging and keeping with stock OpenWRT kamikaze base...
it is a work in progress for sure.

Subject: Freeradius + acctupdate option
Message-ID: <005d01c7f5f0$573b51d0$05b1f570$@com>

Just a quick question regarding the post below if you don?t mind.

Ive tried to append ?acctupdate to the config file, but it results in an
error being thrown (unknown command) ? is this option still supported?

Lastly,

I don?t have attrs.accounting_response file ? ive installed a few times now
but never end up with this file ? could someone please email me a copy?

Regards to all

David

Original Post:

If you need to manage multiple concurrent login and you want to have 
Session-Timeout dinamically update on coovachilli when a user login
multiple time, David add an amazing option, --acctupdate, that get
the NON-standard response to acctupdate packets to radius with some
attributes, like the Session-Timeout.

But now the problem is: How to make it working with freeradius and mysql?

Well, this is how:

Firt of all, look at
http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli/WithFreeRADIUS and do the
required changes to attrs.accounting_response file.

Now, on radiusd.conf, in the module {} section, 
add this:

   attr_rewrite updatesessiontimeout {
      attribute = Session-Timeout
      searchin = reply
      searchfor = "[+ ]"
      replacewith = "%{sql:SELECT ch.Value-IF(SUM(acct.AcctSessionTime) IS
NULL, 0, SUM(acct.AcctSessionTime)) \
                      FROM radcheck AS ch LEFT JOIN radacct AS acct \
                      ON acct.Username=ch.UserName AND
acct.AcctSessionId!='%{Acct-Session-Id}'\
                      AND acct.AcctUniqueId!='%{Acct-Unique-Session-Id}' \
                      WHERE ch.UserName='%{User-Name}' AND
ch.Attribute='Max-All-Session'"
      new_attribute = yes
      append = no
   }

Now, in the acctupdate {} section add simply updatesessiontimeout and
voila', le jeux son fait!

This assume that you have Max-All-Session in radcheck table, if you have it
in radgroupcheck you need to 
modify a bit the sql query.

Just because isn't documented:

                      FROM radcheck AS ch LEFT JOIN radacct AS acct \
                      ON acct.Username=ch.UserName AND
acct.AcctSessionId!='%{Acct-Session-Id}'\
                      AND acct.AcctUniqueId!='%{Acct-Unique-Session-Id}' \
                      WHERE ch.UserName='%{User-Name}' AND
ch.Attribute='Max-All-Session'"
      new_attribute = yes
      append = no
   }

The acctupdate option is new in 1.0.7. The FreeRADIUS documentation is
using FreeRADIUS 2.0 (from CVS), I do believe... I hope this helps.

I am trying to drop all tcp traffic from 10.1.1.0/24 to 192.168.0.1 Port 80
but when I enter the Source destination Coova complains. Any help would be
appreciated.

Hello,

Today CoovaAP 1.0-beta.6 was released. see:
http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaAP

As always, be careful when flashing. If upgrading from an older  
CoovaAP version, be sure to use the "trx" image. If flashing from  
original firmware or tftp, then use the .bin versions.

Cheers,
David

PS: Was recently asked about using your CoovaAAA account as the  
"RADIUS Auto Config" -- don't... your account is not for that purpose  
(a future feature in terms of account specific configurations).
