Subject: [Cap] CoovaAP Whiterussian build procedure/howto
Message-ID: <AANLkTikeNY-ZM1MKQ5xH5HEg_-8hkEW5NqL9QRT9FXXf@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried but couldn't figure out the correct way to build CoovaAP firmware on
OpenWrt Whiterussion 0.9. There's not much instructions that I can find
online. Would really appreciate if someone can give me a link or share some
tips.

Here's what I've done so far:
- downloaded OpenWrt Whiterussion 0.9 via svn
- downloaded CoovaAP packages from SVN (http://dev.coova.org/svn/coova-ap/)
- applied svn-rev-9287.patch  patch (seems ok except for one file)
- copied coova-ap/packages into whiterussian_0.9/package (not sure if this
is correct)

Thanks,
Shoks
