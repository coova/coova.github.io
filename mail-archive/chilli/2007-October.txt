Subject: Something of interest...

Here is something of interest to all coova-chilli users:

	http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/Template:NASVendorAccountingTable

Yes, I admit the mistake of changing the default of coova-chilli to  
being something less-than RFC compliant. However, the option  
'swapoctets' has been in coova-chilli to reverse the non-compliance  
since the first "coova-" version. The above URL talks about the  
meaning of the Acct-Input-* and Acct-Output-* attributes in RADIUS.  
The change for chilli came when the primary concern was compatibility  
with other access controllers. However, this difference, and the  
possible user-configuration differences, means that the meaning of  
"Input" vs. "Output" may not always be taken for granted. Of course,  
in a closed homogeneous network, it is not a big issue. But, when  
considering roaming between entities, this could be problematic, indeed.

If you have addition or corrections for the table, login to the wiki  
and, well, you know.

Subject: Patch for configurable radius timeout settings
Message-ID: <47275445.3090005@ollisnet.de>

Hello,

I tried again to upload the patch in the forum[1], but I still get an
error message about .patch or .diff is not accepted. That's why I sent
this to this mailing list.

The attached patch implements support to configure:
- the timeout value for Radius (default 1500)
- the retry count for sending packets to radius server (default 6)
- the retry count to switch to secondary radius server (default 3)

We tested it already over several months now and it seems to be stable.
But maybe someone can re-check the patch before committing them into the
repository.

Thanks!

Greetings
Oliver Hinckel
