hello,
I wonder if any plans about updating the CoovaAP version?
Coovachilli is now at 1.12 but in coovaap it is still in 1.07.

That might be nice to see a updated version on the site :)

Subject: Compilation error with latest svn 181 on ubuntu 7.10
Message-ID: <f71cb680809100911r60dbf3cblb4b7bafdfa14fce@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i'm having issues trying to compile latest svn revision 181 on ubuntu 7.10.

Following these commands:

**************
svn checkout http://dev.coova.org/svn/coova-chilli/
cd coova-chilli
sh bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
**************

make returns with the following error:

**************
root at izc:/usr/src/coova-chilli# make
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/coova-chilli'
cd . && autoheader
configure.in:18: warning: AC_ARG_PROGRAM invoked multiple times
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/coova-chilli'
cd . \
          && CONFIG_FILES= CONFIG_HEADERS=[config.h] \
             /bin/bash ./config.status
config.status: error: cannot find input file: [config.h].in
make: *** [stamp-h] Error 1
**************

i have to manually replace "CONFIG_HEADERS=[config.h]" with
"CONFIG_HEADERS=[config.h]" in Makefile, then it compiles succesfully.

Someone having the same compilation issue? What am i missing?

Thank you,

Marco

Hi guys,

Does anyone know exactly how this is counted? On what OSI layer does it 
count the bytes? Transport layer? Network (IP) layer? Or even lower? I'd 
like to do some reconciliation with third party tools, right now they 
don't agree but probably because they're counting payloads at different 
OSI layers...

Hmm.. good question. The answer, of course, is right there in the source
code. It depends on if you are using a tun or a tap device, where 99% of
the time, you are using a tun. The entire packet (as seen by chilli) is
counted... so, with tun, that would be the IP layer. If using a tap
interface, it is the entire Ethernet segment. 

The RADIUS RFC doesn't specify what layer to consider when counting
octets.. maybe it does make sense to only count the IP payload.. hm.
