You might also have a look to "ALCASAR". The control center of this 
application allow you to create multi-users vouchers.
The documentation is now completely translated.

I have made my own UAM and never had issue myself but some people get
incorrect password even when using the correct password. Has anyone
experienced this? I thought it was just a old challenge in the session but
sometimes they try to login 20 times and it keeps saying wrong password.

Subject: [Chilli] Accounting-Off
Message-ID: <CADao4Co-0Mkv2gROBtAdZQ8+uda0BDz78md5tQabdey=PsUgkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi CoovaChilli List

To reduce rogue entries in FR, it is good practice for an NAS to send an
Accounting-Off followed by an Accounting-On packet. How can i configure
CoovaChilli1.3.0 to send Accounting-Off?

any help ?


Thanks

If you haven't disabled it built-time from the configure script, and you
aren't using session "keep-alive" runtime option, it should be sending
Accounting-On/Off when you start/stop chilli.

Has anyone managed to allow TeamViewer though the firewall before user logs
in?

Have you considered using chilli_query to obtain the list of assigned ips?
