<PRE>Hi all!

I used SVN 147 for a long time and recently switched to SVN 155.

However a strange issue occured - so far I only got feedback that  
Vista machines are involved (does not mean that other OS may not be  
affected as well).

Effect:
The user logs in and browses the Internet. After some time, while his  
session is still active, he suddenly is redirected to the UAM page  
with res=already. No matter which URL he enters, he gets back to this  
page.

With SVN 147 this problem did not occur (all parameters are identical  
- only chilli was replaced).

I ran Coova-chilli in debug mode. The only thing which looks  
suspicious is the &quot;DHCP requested IP address&quot;:

chilli.c: 110: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 1, bucketup: 92,  
bucketdown: 0, up: 92, down: 0
... etc etc
chilli.c: 110: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 0, bucketup: 180,  
bucketdown: 257, up: 0, down: 40
chilli.c: 2515: 0 (Debug) DHCP requested IP address
chilli.c: 110: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 4, bucketup: 180,  
bucketdown: 297, up: 78, down: 0
chilli.c: 110: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 0, bucketup: 78,  
bucketdown: 0, up: 0, down: 112
chilli.c: 2515: 0 (Debug) DHCP requested IP address
chilli.c: 2515: 0 (Debug) DHCP requested IP address
chilli.c: 2515: 0 (Debug) DHCP requested IP address
chilli.c: 2515: 0 (Debug) DHCP requested IP address
chilli.c: 2515: 0 (Debug) DHCP requested IP address
chilli.c: 110: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 239, bucketup: 78,  
bucketdown: 112, up: 68, down: 0
chilli.c: 110: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 0, bucketup: 68,  
bucketdown: 0, up: 0, down: 95
redir.c: 1948: 0 (Debug) Calling redir_getstate()
redir.c: 1963: 0 (Debug) Get HTTP Request
... etc etc


At the time I was lucky to debug there was no other user at this  
location. Does anyone have an idea what could cause such a behaviour?  
Why is Coova-chilli suddenly redirecting?

Thanks, lc

</PRE>
