<PRE>I'm using this version of chilli, on open-mesh routers, with an updated
iPod touch, without problems. A network trace would help diagnose the
problem. 

Though, I have noticed that the iPod sometimes has issues when it sees
multiple nodes with the same SSID. For instance, I'll get a DHCP lease
from one (further) node, and then it seems the iPod switched to talking
to the closer node, without doing a new DHCP lease. If you release your
DHCP lease, does it help?
