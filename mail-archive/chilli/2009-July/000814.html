<PRE>My guess is that this is all highly device/driver specific. With a
little testing with the iPod, I'm seeing

- It associated with AP1/BSSID1 and did DHCP, all is fine
- I walked (almost) out of range and into range of AP2/BSSID2
- iPod shows full signal bars, but no connectivity in Safari, it has
same IP assigned by AP1 (I'm using anyip, so that shouldn't matter
much).
- Used the app called &quot;WifiTrak&quot; to show signals (and BSSIDs)
- WiFiTrak shows my target SSID, BSSID2, and that I'm NOT connected. It
doesn't list BSSID1 at all (though still thinks it is connected to it).

Interestingly, just running WiFiTrak seems to usually cause the problem
to resolve as I'm guessing it triggers a re-association (and also a new
DHCP lease request) on the new AP2/BSSID2. It will also resolve if I
renew the DHCP lease or just wait enough time. So, I'm thinking that the
iPod isn't exactly behaving like it should.
