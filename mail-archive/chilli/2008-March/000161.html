&gt;<i> Hi Gunther,

</I>I'm aware of the acctupdate feature and was planning on using it in the 
future in any case but as far as I can tell it doesn't cause another 
execution of conup. Am I right? I guess what I need for this purpose is 
an &quot;acctupdateup&quot; script that's executed whenever parameters change 
mid-session. While I'm sure that wouldn't be difficult to code up I 
think I don't need that just yet.

By the way, what is the standard way of changing session parameters half 
way through a current session? There was talk some time ago about CoA 
but all information I've read so far is about unsolicited disconnects...
&gt;<i> If someone is transitioning from free to paid, wouldn't you want them 
</I>&gt;<i> to see a login page as a form of notification of the change?
</I>If a user has both freebies and paid credits I want the transition to be 
seamless, i.e. no logoff, login page, re-login cycle. The change can 
fairly easily be communicated in the status window.

Gunther
