<PRE>Hi guys,

Is it possible in coova to try and re-authenticate a given client at the 
end of their session?

Reason I'm asking: we have customers who get a free bandwidth allocation 
and over and above that they have to pay. In order to improve the 
service offering it would be nice to prioritise the paid traffic over 
the free one but the only way I can see that being done is through the 
conup/condown scripts which unfortunately cannot work during a session 
(only at start and stop). Therefore I can only distinguish between free 
and paid traffic by using two distinct sessions and therefore I'd like 
one session to smoothly take over from the previous one (free allocation 
used up =&gt; free session stop =&gt; reauthentication =&gt; paid session start 
=&gt; traffic prioritisation =&gt; paid session stop =&gt; undo traffic 
prioritisation)

I remember looking into this re-authentication stuff quite some time ago 
but cannot remember the specifics and cannot find related config options 
in the Coova documentation...

Gunther
