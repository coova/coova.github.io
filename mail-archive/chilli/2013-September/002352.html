<PRE>Hi guys,

Looking for a solution in my case.
I have 7 APs running openwrt with coova chilli 1.2.9
All in the same network through out a hotel.
There all calling back to an external radius server with a custom 
captive portal.

If client 1 logs in with his voucher at AP1 he will move then to another 
location in the building will need to log in again.
Is there a build in feature or something that will allow that guest to 
connect without getting the splash page?
Also the idle time-out is set to 60 minutes with 2 max sessions per voucher.
So if that person logs in in 2 different APs , he will not be able to 
log on the 3th one.

Any thoughts?

Regards
