Message-ID: <504516AB.2050407@tiendalinux.com>

Hi Guys. ( i have already post this on the website forum)

I have a couple of servers running coova chilli and they all run fine.

However people reports that sometimes the coova chilli turns 
unresponsive, i run chilli with debug option as follows:

/usr/sbin/chilli -c /etc/chilli.conf --debug

and after some days or hours chilli keeps logging the following to the 
syslog forever:

Aug 24 11:17:07 panorama coova-chilli[28483]: dhcp.c: 230: Layer2 appconn
Aug 24 11:17:07 panorama coova-chilli[28483]: dns.c: 73: bad value 7/1494/6
Aug 24 11:17:07 panorama coova-chilli[28483]: dns.c: 155: failed parsing 
DNS packet
Aug 24 11:17:07 panorama coova-chilli[28483]: dhcp.c: 1619: dropping 
malformed DNS
Aug 24 11:17:07 panorama coova-chilli[28483]: dhcp.c: 1978: dhcp_dns()

I am not sure what triggers this behavior, i will have to set up a 
fail2ban script to monitor this on syslog and then restart coova chilli 
when it happens, but before that i will like to report this behavior and 
read your comments on that, as i think that could be probably a bug in 
coova chilli.

Slds.

Is chilli crashing right after these log entries? What version are you
running? If not current (or even better, a recent 1.3.0-svn from
subversion), can you upgrade easily?

Hi, i am running coova chilli 1.2.9 under debian squeeze and 1.2.8 under 
debian lenny, the problem have been reported on the machine that runs 
debian lenny, i don't think this is related to the debian distribution, 
chilli hotspot keeps working, but it enter in an endless loop with a 
malformed DNS entry log, i have no way to check if it works fine but 
people who use the hotspot report the internet become slow.

I have another weird issue, after i installed chilli also the servers 
began to refuse connections to user root after a while, the only way is 
to restart the server, login as another user or restart the ssh daemon, 
i can't say this could be related with chilli but the problems began to 
appear when i installed chilli spot, i have google for a solution but it 
seems to be an old problem not present on modern distributions which is 
strange either.

auth.log.5.gz:Aug 29 08:59:32 panorama sshd[28150]: Accepted publickey 
for root from X.X.X.X port 33565 ssh2
auth.log.5.gz:Aug 29 08:59:32 panorama sshd[28150]:

chilli runs under chilli user.

Subject: [Chilli] Chilli 1.2.9 sudently crash
Message-ID: <1665973.yvZcc3Ndjp@athlon>

Hi,
I deployed a coova chilli solution based on freeradius coupled with postgres.
The customer related several crash, followed each time by a reboot.
In that case, it's not really obvious to obtain the crash's reasons...

Recently, once I was with the customer, a crash arose, chilli was dead without 
any particular reason. Nothing in dmesh, either in /var/log/messages.

The only way I had on that time, was to open a wired ssh connection and 
restart chilli. Curiously, I lost the ssh connection, never met until that 
case. Ping or any other ssh try was responding.

I didn't have enough time to diagnose what happened, I rebooted the server.

As I read, I'm not alone in that case.

Is it possible to have some trace when chili crash without to start it in a 
full debug mode ?

Thanks
J. Paul

Just updated to r474, compiled fine without issue on FreeBSD 
10.0-CURRENT r239772.

You can google for how to setup your system to save core dumps on
crashing... if you compile chilli with -g option, it would be helpful
too in combination. You can then run gdb on your coredump and binary for
a glimpse at where it crashed. What version is this? if not a recent
one, you should try upgrading. Also, and features you are using (compile
and runtime) might be relevant.

Thanks for the gdb output. The "this" pointer being NULL in
dhcp_data_req() is certainly a problem. The "dhcp connection" must have
been cleared out without the "app connection" being reset -- certainly
an edge case which "should" never happen. I've committed a check in that
function to prevent it going further and segfaulting in this case. If
could give it a test to see if the crash continues. 

Cheers,
David

Subject: [Chilli] coova chilli multiple provider based on VLAN
Message-ID: <1347334024.284.YahooMailClassic@web162003.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

I want to configure coova chilli so that the traffic will go to different providers, for example, 

VLAN 100-199 = goes to service provider 1
VLAN 200-299 = goes to service provider 2
VLAN 300-399 = goes to service provider 3

Each of the service provider will probably connected to the WAN of coova chilli using a separate physical interface ( ethX ) or a virtual VLAN trunk ( ethWAN.provide1_vlan ). For example

service provider 1 = eth1.100
service provider 2 = eth1.200
service provider 3 = eth1.300

I only run one copy of coova chilli. How do I accomplish this configuration ? Do I have to use the multple route functionality. I could not find enough information about how to use the MULTIPLE ROUTE functions.

Thanks a 1 million.
