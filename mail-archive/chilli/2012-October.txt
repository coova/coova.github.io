Subject: [Chilli] Group-based URL filtering
Message-ID: <CAENMwEBnv5AF=jK2jkxZU2wQ4L+L6mEXhPQUJnHPussDtqthLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.
I have a full working coovachilli/freeradius installation, with
transparent proxy done by dansguardia+squid, that allows me to filter
URL requested by client.
I would like to create groups on radius server, and give them
different surf pemission. For example i would like to create two
groups, one with full permission, and the other with some restriction.
I'm trying to collect some hints from the internet, but it seems there
is not a lot of material...
Anyone here has any suggest?
Regards.

AFAIK this isn't a chilli feature via squid.
you can write an external handler and configure it in squid. in that handler you should check the IP if needs to be filtered or not. based on the return code of the helper squid will serve or not the request.

== ChangeLog (CoovaChilli-v1.3.0 svn revision 479) ==

* Removed chilli query command ''listip'', use ''list up'' instead

* Added option ''only8021q'' to only handle VLAN traffic on an interface
* When not using enable-largelimits, the RADIUS queue will allocate
packet storage dynamically
* Added AVL support for indexing locations and maintaining statistics
* Fixed memory usage issue and added options ''dhcphashsize'' and
''radiusqsize''
* Added runtime option ''redirurl'' to have a redirection URL put into
the UAM query string parameters instead of a HTTP redirect

Cheers,
David

Subject: [Chilli] Coova-Chilli JSON login and status pages implementation
Message-ID: <5087B10E.9050700@nethesis.it>

Hi all.
I have worked on a Coova Chilli login page implementation using JSON 
controller that i consider simpler than the one included in the original 
sources. This implementation would be also more compatible with some old 
browser (like IE6 or old version of Safari) because uses the JQuery 
library for the purpose of handling events.
Download url: http://update.nethesis.it/www-coova-jbez.tar.gz

You need to address uamformat and uamhomepage as following (all in one 
login page):

HS_UAMFORMAT=http://\$HS_UAMLISTEN:\$HS_UAMUIPORT/www/login.html
HS_UAMHOMEPAGE=http://\$HS_UAMLISTEN:\$HS_UAMUIPORT/www/login.html

Regards.
