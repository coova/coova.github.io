I don't think that permitting only A and CNAME is too restrictive,
opposite, i think that is too permissive, i don't use dnsparanoia option
as i was fight with dnstunnels before it was developed, but with my
system i also check the rate of records A and CNAME to permit only few
request for minute  from a single host.

This cause many nstunnelling software can make tunnels also over A
records, so, dropping all but A and CNAME isn't a final solution.

The problem i think that is related on how dnsparanoia manage dns
request different from A and CNAME. If i understand right, it simply
DROP any request that don't match A or CNAME type. This cause firefox to
wait for reply, so, it need to wait for a sort of internal timeout or
resolver timeout. This is why you see ff so slow.

dnsparanoia in my opinion shuld respond also on others query, but with a
fake response like &quot;no record found&quot;. I do this and i have no sloweness
on ff or other browsers

</I>
To check if you have problems with dnstunnels you can permit to use only
a specific dns server hosted by you, and analizing the requests you can
discover dnstunnels.

I was having many problems with dnstunnels some time ago, this is why i
was implementing my way to save me from dnstunnels before dnsparanoia
was implemented. When dnsparanoia will do also some others and more
paranoic checks on request rate over A and CNAME, maybe i will use it,
but actually it isn't so &quot;paranoia&quot; for me :)
