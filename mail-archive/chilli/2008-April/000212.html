<PRE>&gt;<i> No problem. While I was editing it I actually wondered how you  
</I>&gt;<i> linked the two and ensured consistency. Do you have a strategy  
</I>&gt;<i> there? Or is it just: you change one, you change the other?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
actually, i have a super simple &quot;man2wiki&quot; routine in the doc/ 
fmttxt.pl script... but, you can also edit in both places if that is  
faster.

&gt;<i> I'll start making those documentation changes then in the code. I  
</I>&gt;<i> noticed a few other things (radiustimeout related) and there's my  
</I>&gt;<i> uamanyip arp lan exclude patch from last time, how are code  
</I>&gt;<i> development things resolved in coova? Are there any procedures?  
</I>&gt;<i> Where and how do we discuss code issues before changing and  
</I>&gt;<i> committing (there's no <A HREF="http://lists.coova.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/chilli">chilli-devel at coova.org</A>)? Is there even a  
</I>&gt;<i> person other than you who has svn write access at the moment?
</I>
hm, yet this list isn't overly active...

everyone who has asked has gotten svn access thus far... it's only a  
couple of people. people contribute patches to the list too, which is  
usually integrated directly in.

cheers,
david
