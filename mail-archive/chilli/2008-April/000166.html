</I>If you are right then it definitely is being too restrictive as my 
firefox really is taking forever(&gt;20sec) to resolve my uamserver 
(without dnsparanoia it's lightning fast). Not sure though what types 2, 
6 and 12 really are and if it really is firefox that's causing them. 
Else I think the packet type detection might be broken.

</I>I did turn it off now. I doubt I really have a problem with dns tunnel 
abuse, though this is really hard to know for sure. I mean it really is 
infeasible run tcpdump at all my sites the whole day and then sift 
through the output to detect possible abuse. I guess I'm just that - 
suffering from dnsparanoia ;-)
