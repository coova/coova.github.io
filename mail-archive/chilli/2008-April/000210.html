<PRE>Oh, and thanks for the wiki contribution... FYI, the &quot;man&quot; pages in  
the wiki are taken fro the man pages in the coova-chilli source. So,  
you might also consider those changes there too (doc/chilli.conf. 
5.in). If you want svn access too, just send me a md5 style htpasswd  
entry for yourself.

</I>&gt;<i> I carried out the packet dumps again from the box that runs chilli

</I>&gt;<i> I had to use the coaport option together with coanoipcheck (because  
</I>&gt;<i> my PoD packets would come through an openvpn tunnel, not from any  
</I>&gt;<i> of the defined radiusservers) so tried to harden my setup by doing  
</I>&gt;<i> the checking in the firewall. Unfortunately in the process I didn't  
</I>&gt;<i> realise that the coaport option also causes all Accounting Requests  
</I>&gt;<i> to be sent from that port which is where my assumptions broke down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To cut a long story short it was my stupidity rather than your code  
</I>&gt;<i> that caused the mess and the behaviour I saw indeed was just chilli  
</I>&gt;<i> trying to retransmit whatever it never received a reply for. The  
</I>&gt;<i> radauth stuff of course ran flawlessly so that I could log in fine,  
</I>&gt;<i> which is why I never detected the problem when I did my initial  
</I>&gt;<i> firewall testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologise for jumping to conclusions despite days of debugging...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the end I can recommend v1.0.11 for all purposes.
