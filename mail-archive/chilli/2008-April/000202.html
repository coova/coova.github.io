</I>Nope, there is one and only one accounting response coming back for each 
and every request, even for all the bogus ones which get sent in very 
quick succession.

</I>I know that but Accounting-On has got no place whatsoever halfway 
through a live session. In fact a well written system would do exactly 
what you say - honour these packets and clear out all sessions from this 
nas which are still open. If I did that I'd close sessions that are 
perfectly fine...

I think to demonstrate to you the seriousness of these corruptions that 
I recorded I will send you those packet dumps that I created. I'm not 
sure if this list strips binary attachments so just to be safe I'll send 
them to you directly but if anyone else would like to see them let me know.
