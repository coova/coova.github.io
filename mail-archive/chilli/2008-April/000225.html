<PRE>
Some time ago I reported a strange behavior of SVN 155 and later 159.

We found that under unknown and rare circumstances chilli starts to  
redirect to the UAM server with res=already although the session is  
active. No matther what is entered in the web browser, the user is  
redirected. This behaviour does not start right away after a login,  
but some minutes later.

Today we ran another test at a heavy used location. And we got lucky  
(if you can call this luck) - the problem occured at one Vista user.

Here are two corresponding lines of our UAM-Server log. There was no  
other communication with our UAM Server within this timeframe.

[26/Apr/2008:16:50:31 +0200] &quot;GET /?res=success
[26/Apr/2008:16:59:44 +0200] &quot;GET /?res=already
After this line many &quot;already&quot; lines followed - a few minutes later,  
the user gave up. But for 9 minutes chilli worked as it should.

His computer info: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0;  
SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

We do not know for sure but so far we only noticed this problem when  
Vista was used.

But we know for sure that

- affected users do not go to the login page (=the problem starts  
suddenly without the user doing anything)
- no matter which URL they enter they are always redirected to the UAM  
server with res=already
- chilli keeps sending acct-interim updates, so this is an indication  
that chilli knows the session is active
- chilli closes the session correctly after the affected users give up
- chilli does not send any radius requests when it keeps redirecting
- there must be something which triggers this behaviour

A few days ago I was at a location and by chance a user was having  
this problem. So I sat next to him and tried it myself - no matter  
what I did, chilli redirected me. After this I stopped chilli and  
started it in debug mode. And guess what: The problem did not occur.  
After I left the user stayed for quite a long time. He logged on and  
was logged off (timeout), but this issue did not happen again.

We have reason to believe what it does not happen with the current  
1.0.11 release.

Questions: did anybody use chilli SVN 155 or newer out on the field?   
Are there any ideas what could trigger this behavior? How can we help  
to gather more information? Is there a special debug mode to watch  
closer why chilli starts to redirect?









&gt;<i> Hi David,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just returned to my office and checked the logs of this location.  
</I>&gt;<i> Funny: the same user is still there and he opened new sessions and  
</I>&gt;<i> it seems the problem did not occur so far. This leaves me even more  
</I>&gt;<i> clueless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could a miscommunication between chilli and the radius server cause  
</I>&gt;<i> such a behaviour? It is strange because if it occurs for a few  
</I>&gt;<i> minutes everything looks fine, and then suddenly the effect starts.  
</I>&gt;<i> The start of the session means chilli got a green light from Radius.  
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe immediatly if the communication is somehow not successful  
</I>&gt;<i> immediately after chilli starts to think after a few minutes that  
</I>&gt;<i> the session is actually not ok? I ask because sometimes it seems  
</I>&gt;<i> that chilli is not getting radius replies, therefore keeps  
</I>&gt;<i> retransmitting. This does not happen very often, but it happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am kind of desperate because I saw it with my own eyes but after  
</I>&gt;<i> restarting chilli I could not reproduce it today :(

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Today I spent a few hours at one of those locations and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I keep wondering what could cause chilli to act this way? Why would
