<PRE>No worries, we all have those days :)

I figured it wasn't too serious considering we would have heard about  
it already from others. Just like IT professionals, we don't really  
hear from our customers until there are problems. Not many people  
come to the list or forum with &quot;it works great, no complaints&quot; :)

</I>&gt;<i> To cut a long story short it was my stupidity rather than your code

</I>&gt;<i> which is why I never detected the problem when I did my initial

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologise for jumping to conclusions despite days of debugging...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the end I can recommend v1.0.11 for all purposes.
