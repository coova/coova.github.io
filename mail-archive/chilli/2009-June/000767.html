hey, that sounds really great. So with that option and a vlan capable

That's interesting. Could it be used to &quot;pause&quot; a running chilli?
I have chilli's running in HA environments (keepalived). The chillis on
slaves should not answer to requests, thus i filter on those systems
with ebtables for now. A possibility to externally set chilli on hold
would do the same job, but better so i think.

Very cool.

Can't wait for the release :)


Thank's
