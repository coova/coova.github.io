<PRE>Hi all

I had the same issue sometimes too. It seemed to be related to the DHCP
lease policy. The device asks for a new IP, even if still an address is
assigned to it. Then you have to stop the reservation (chilli_query
logout) for the mentioned session/device and the whole DHCP procedure
worked again, after a browser refresh. This issue seems to be much
better since 1.0.12 and it occurred the most on 3G iPhones and Nokia
N95/N96s, but also sometimes on other devices.

Subject: CC + FreeRadius - splash page randomly appears

Hi all,

I'm using Coova Chilli 1.0.13 with freeradius and mac authentication
(and the macauth and macreauth directives in chilli.conf).

What's always happening to me (prior to 1.0.13 and the macreauth
directive) is that sometimes (mid session) the splash page (uamserver?)
appears to the user even though their mac address is in the radcheck and
usergroup tables.

Generally this problem doesn't happen but it's easy enough to reproduce
by just keeping a computer associated to the Coovachilli hotspot
throughout the day and, every now and then, the splash page pops up.  A
refresh or browser address bar re-entry fixes the problem but its
annoying and I've had complaints from some users that the problem is
worse for them (maybe its not and they complain more...)

I'm pretty sure there isn't any timeout errors between coova chilli and
the freeradius server (nothing obvious with &quot;logread&quot; in openwrt) and
the bandwidth is good and always on.

Has anyone else seen things like this happening?

thanks

Derek
