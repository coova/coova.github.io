&gt;<i> &gt; weeks. It has major changes, including direct 802.1Q support so a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chilli can control your entire VLAN trunk. The configuration system
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> hey, that sounds really great. So with that option and a vlan capable
</I>&gt;<i> switch clients would be completely separated, would they?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yeah.. though, the typical use will likely be that APs are VLAN'ed and
bridged into a trunked network. You can then have a single chilli
instance running and servicing all these APs. The VLAN id will be sent
to the captive portal and to the RADIUS server. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changed drastically in that the cmdline.o (generated by gengetopt) will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only be linked into a new utility &quot;chilli_opt&quot;. This new util is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; responsible for parsing, resolving, and building the runnable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration. It's launched by chilli on startup, but can also be ran
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offline to update the configuration of a running chilli. Since chilli
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's interesting. Could it be used to &quot;pause&quot; a running chilli?
</I>&gt;<i> I have chilli's running in HA environments (keepalived). The chillis on
</I>&gt;<i> slaves should not answer to requests, thus i filter on those systems
</I>&gt;<i> with ebtables for now. A possibility to externally set chilli on hold
</I>&gt;<i> would do the same job, but better so i think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Interesting... I'd do the 'pause' differently, I think. You'd probably
want to use the chilli_query and an option to stop (stop processing all
sockets in the main chilli loop _except_ processing the cmdsock
socket). 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forks the utility, it'll never stop and wait for DNS resolution. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;tap&quot; interface have also been rewritten a bit such that a chilli tap
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interface can be added to a bridge... to run chilli on a more pure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layer2 network. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very cool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
