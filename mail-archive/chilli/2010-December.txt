So far so good!
r409 has lasted for about 24h without crashing.
I'm running it in debug mode with symbols. In case it will crash I'll
send you a new backtrace.

Thank you for now!

Apologies Marco, I sent you stuff for the list as I'm not used to this
lists reply-to methods.

I was having the same issue.

It would appear that in the tarball download for 1.2.5, debian/rules
has a change that isn't in SVN at the release revision.
This change of
$(MAKE) DESTDIR=$(CURDIR)/debian/tmp install
to
$(MAKE) DESTDIR=$(CURDIR)/debian/coova-chilli install
seems to be what is causing the problem.

r323 seems to be where the change was made, but appears to have been
reversed in 327
For some reason 1.2.5 which is supposed to be r394 has the incorrect
file. (Maybe a svn update wasn't performed correctly before
packaging?)

There are some more differences too. Makes me wonder about the
packaging process.

Just checked out revision 409 for Coova Chilli and while bstring gets made
the so file does not get put in a directory that can be used while doing the
install. This is on a debian lenny distro.

Subject: [Chilli] chilli_radconfig, adminuser
Message-ID: <AANLkTim5kWcmBmcDv2NjZorcUVZOhMvhMubx2O=O3HEX@mail.gmail.com>

I'm looking for more information regarding the radconfig and fetching
ChilliSpot-Config attributes.

I've looked through the man pages and the forums, but can't find the
information I'm looking for.

In particular, how do we setup the Administrative-User? Is it just
another user in the radcheck and radreply tables? Does it need a
special attribute in the radcheck/reply table to prevent it being used
as a normal user and only as a session/system user?

Where do we return the ChilliSpot-Config attributes from (I assume
radreply if the user is in radcheck) and what format are these in?
Seeing as they need to be a name and a value pair, except the
Attribute Name in the reply from radreply will be ChilliSpotConfig,
are both the name and value somehow stored in the Value of that
Attribute?

Lastly, what format are the names in? I assume they are in the format
expected for chilli.conf (http://coova.org/CoovaChilli/chilli.conf)
and not the format in the config file that is parsed by functions.sh.

More documentation on this feature would be great, as it seems to be a
very powerful feature that is probably not used as much as it could
be.

Thanks

Tim

Message-ID: <AANLkTinFbYsqcf5Y200hWk3jj5vzsdGHtGcB9=3dLV3_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to migrate from Chillispot to CoovaChilli however have hit a
problem. When accessing a site outside the walled garden I am successfully
redirected to my login page. When I attempt to login I get sent to
http://<ip>:3990/logon
with the appropriate get parameters (username and response) however it just
sits there and doesn't appear to do anything. Looking at the radius logs it
does appear to attempt to authenticate the user at all and the Chilli logs
don't appear to reveal anything either.

Thanks,
Peter

Looking further into it appears that /logon is proxing the request to the
actual login page. We have rotating adds running on our login page and if we
refresh the page then the ads rotate.
