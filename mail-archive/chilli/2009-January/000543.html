<PRE>Hi all,

I've found that Coova Chilli works excellently with OpenWRT based APs and
freeradius on a central (Internet) server:

I'm easily able to add a user's MAC address into the radcheck and
usergroup tables and after this the user can get past my &quot;splash screen&quot; -
super.

BUT, and this is the reason for my post today, what I haven't worked out
is how to tell Coova Chilli to do a frequent check against the free radius
server to see if the user (by MAC) is still in there.

I'm automatically removing the user from the tables with a script that
runs on the [same server as] freeradius server.

Example: When a user tries to access the web on my Coova Chilli enabled AP
they are redirected to my splash page (because their MAC is NOT in the
free radius tables). Then they accept that they want free access and I add
them in to the free radius tables and then I send them on to their
requested Internet page. Because they [MAC] are now in the free radius
tables they ARE allowed Internet access. After 5 minutes I erase their MAC
entry from the free radius tables. HERE IS THE CRUNCH: I notice that you
may still have, say, 1 hour on the Internet even though their MAC is no
longer in the free radius tables.

I'm guessing that this is because Coova Chilli is just not often
re-checking against the free radius server that the user should still get
access?

Does anyone know how to tune this in Coova Chilli?


thanks very much!!!


Derek
