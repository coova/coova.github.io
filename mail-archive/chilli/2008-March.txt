Hi,
When using privoxy ant tiny together I see some errors on framed pages.
Ex: www.w3schools.com/tags/planets.htm (an ordinary framed page)
Error is : "Could not load template file connect-failed or one of it's
included components"

Can privoxy process framed pages? If not, are there any other html
pages, tags such as frames that privoxy can not process?

To be honest, it's been awhile since I've used the captive frame.  
But, if memory serves, the HTML <head> tag is being searched for in  
order to insert the code that implements the captive frame.  The page  
you linked to doesn't have a head tag, perhaps that is the reason it  
fails. There are other sites where the captive frame fails too - any  
site doing javascript to enforce the page is in the top-most frame,  
for instance.

New, actually useful, hotspot tools from the "Labs" :)

It is a Firefox extension taking advantage of the simple WISPr client  
found in JRadius. I have tested it with both CoovaAP/Chilli and  
Colubris access controllers, but it should work with just about any  
WISPr implementation.

Check it out!

	Speaking of the WISPr, is there a list somewhere of WISPr enabled
devices? I'd like to be able to get one to test a UAM against it to make 
sure the coding is correct.

Not that I know of... there are a number of smart-clients, though. Boingo,
iPass, and I believe devices using devicescape.

Hi,
I am trying to count web hits of users. With using proxy it is seems to
be easy (I tried squid, tiny, privoxy).
But it is obvious that the hits in the logs not purely the hits that
users wanted to do.
For example when a user goes to cnn.com, cnn.com calls other ad pages or
non-ad pages. But because that think happens at users browser it is seen
as an user hit in logs. So for real hit count an analysis must be made
on logs.
Do you know any tool, proxy that can help in such analysis?

Second choice is writing own tool that can be parsing the logs and doing
an analysis on referer field. But in that case (assuming cnn.com
referred pages as non hit) users clicking on a link on the page
(cnn.com) can not be distinguished.
To further investigate the issue I listened (by ethereal) outgoing
packets for a usual user behavior (clicking on a link) and  web site
called web pages. They all seem to have same headers and similar header
values in request packets. So I stucked and could not found any possible
piece of evidence to track and distinguish the behaviours.
Is there a known theoretical or practical way for distinguishing this
behaviours?

Not: I know this mailing list is not the most appropriate list to ask
this question. But any help will be gratefull.

The request for a webpage and an item in a webpage are syntacticly the  
same.  Your best bet would be to analyze the log files, perhaps  
analyzing the different file types requested.

Indeed, it would be very difficult to analyze the traffic perfectly.   
An idea that comes to mind to help classify URLs is to have a privoxy  
(or the like) rewrite URLs found in <a href=""/> tags. You could have  
the URLs bounce of a URL of your own (which notes the URL before  
redirecting to it). But, this isn't a sure thing as there are a  
number of ways a webpage can send you to another page...

When i run freeradius in debug mode i see the username appears correct,
but the password seems like garbage characters as
User-Password = "\310\254\\my\311\324\361 \240\267X\233n\016\205"
but when i test freeradius with radtest command with same shared secret
etc, i have no problem in authenticating..

Where should i look for the problem?
I didnt change anything in freerad. or coova conf files...

Subject: Attempt to re-authenticate at the end of a session
Message-ID: <47E90EE5.4010603@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

Is it possible in coova to try and re-authenticate a given client at the 
end of their session?

Reason I'm asking: we have customers who get a free bandwidth allocation 
and over and above that they have to pay. In order to improve the 
service offering it would be nice to prioritise the paid traffic over 
the free one but the only way I can see that being done is through the 
conup/condown scripts which unfortunately cannot work during a session 
(only at start and stop). Therefore I can only distinguish between free 
and paid traffic by using two distinct sessions and therefore I'd like 
one session to smoothly take over from the previous one (free allocation 
used up => free session stop => reauthentication => paid session start 
=> traffic prioritisation => paid session stop => undo traffic 
prioritisation)

I remember looking into this re-authentication stuff quite some time ago 
but cannot remember the specifics and cannot find related config options 
in the Coova documentation...

Gunther

I know this reply is quite late but perhaps it will still help you. 
Likely your problem is a uamsecret mismatch in the chilli.conf and web 
login script which causes the passwords to get mangled. The former is 
simple to check; the latter we can advise on if you tell us what login 
script you use.

Hi Gunther,

Reauthenticating sessions isn't a feature... though, to change  
session parameters mid-session, you can use the 'acctupdate' feature  
to return this information (in a non-RFC kind of way) in the  
Accounting response. If someone is transitioning from free to paid,  
wouldn't you want them to see a login page as a form of notification  
of the change?

I'm aware of the acctupdate feature and was planning on using it in the 
future in any case but as far as I can tell it doesn't cause another 
execution of conup. Am I right? I guess what I need for this purpose is 
an "acctupdateup" script that's executed whenever parameters change 
mid-session. While I'm sure that wouldn't be difficult to code up I 
think I don't need that just yet.

By the way, what is the standard way of changing session parameters half 
way through a current session? There was talk some time ago about CoA 
but all information I've read so far is about unsolicited disconnects...

If a user has both freebies and paid credits I want the transition to be 
seamless, i.e. no logoff, login page, re-login cycle. The change can 
fairly easily be communicated in the status window.

You can indeed change session parameters in a CoA too. That method is  
preferred over using acctupdate if you can do it (meaning, your  
chilli isn't behind a NAT or has port forwarding for RADIUS).

chilli without a tun/tap interface... what? :)

Ah, seeing that I'm currently implementing a centralised VPN setup for 
all our nas's perhaps I should aim to use CoA rather.

But the challenge still remains and the more I think about it the more 
complex it gets. Let me elaborate: A given user gets a certain free 
daily portion of Internet but also purchased some Internet. The free 
traffic must be normal but the paid for traffic prioritised (QoS) so 
that the user is getting value for money.

How do I, without interrupting the session, fire an event (a QoS script) 
at the time when the free portion has been spent and the paid for 
portion takes over?

My current thoughts:

    * coa packet sometime before the "free" session times out, patch
      chilli to let me fire an event upon CoA. Gotcha: easy to do with
      time based but really tricky with volume accounting (how do you
      know when the user will run out given a max-octets?)
    * the original subject: patch chilli so that upon logout it will
      send accounting stop, followed immediately by a re-authentication
      attempt (with timeout of, say, 10 seconds) and only if
      re-authentication unsuccessful place the user back into the
      unauthenticated(dnat) state. Re-authentication would trigger a
      conup which can then do the QoS. Minor gotcha: users may get an
      extra few seconds of Internet should the radius server be slow to
      react (but perhaps re-authentication can be flagged by radius
      during session initialisation?)

Any other ideas?

Interesting... though not something we would use anytime soon.
