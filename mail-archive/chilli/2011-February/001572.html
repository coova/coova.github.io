<PRE>Hi all,
It's been a long time since my last contribution to the list, but now we
have a problem and we need to find a solution..  David or someone else may
remember about me.

We have an scenario with about 200 hotspots with a large number of users. We
use CoovaAP in a quilte old version, but very stable so far.. so we would
like to avoid changing it. Nowadays we still use as source of the website a
perl script called hostpostlogin.cgi (i don't know if it's the used one in
current version) and we have the problem that with the huge amount of GETs
of this website, our webserver dies.

We were thinking of what to do to solve this, and we have found that about
20~40% of the get's from unauthenticated users are made by Windows Update,
or Antivirus updates or any other webservice.. and we would like to filter
them.

So there is the question, is it possible to do a kind of &quot;walled garden&quot; but
in the opposite way? so that the url's/IP that we set are not redirected to
the captive portal? I've made a few tests using iptables and the several
firewall files present on the firmware, but I could not set this
performance.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance.

Oriol.
