<PRE>Hi David,

</I>
Exactly there was the mistake in my thinking. First of all, I've read
through IEEE 802.11i and IEEE 802.1x and there simply is no such thing
as a disconnect indication from the access point to the RADIUS server.
The AP simply doesn't share its state, so all CoovaChilli can see at any
time is a request to &quot;open the gate&quot;. Which is logical, since both
standards don't want the RADIUS server (or a proxy such as CoovaChilli)
to track state.

Second, I was under the misconception that the two WLANs end up in
different VLANs, which they actually do not currently -- I explicitly
routed the EAP VLAN through CoovaChilli as well since I wanted to reuse
the same IP network independent of the WLAN chosen and it doesn't hurt
if CoovaChilli implements a &quot;second switch&quot; behind the AP, considering
it acts as Radiusproxy.

Now you got me thinking, however. Either use a seperate VLAN for EAP,
then I'd have to assign a second IP net, or extend CoovaChilli so it can
do &quot;dhcpif&quot; on two interfaces at once. Running two Chilli instances
doesn't make much sense in this scenario, I guess.

&gt;<i> Perhaps what you want is a VLAN based option to not allow logout? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mentioned it before, but I personally think removing the logout
</I>&gt;<i> ability is one thing, but probably more important is just to remove the
</I>&gt;<i> LINK to the logout feature for these users. Another idea might be to add
</I>&gt;<i> a query string parameter indicating a &quot;auth=eap&quot; so your portal can know
</I>&gt;<i> not to show a logout link...
</I>
In the patch I developed so far I did something similar: I added a
&quot;allow_logoff&quot; parameter so the portal knows whether it should show a
link or not. Independently, I also had to consider the case where users
enter the word &quot;logout&quot; because it's advertised all over the portal. So
it makes sense to do both: indicate to the portal not to show the link
but also disable the two ways the user has (<A HREF="http://IP/logout">http://IP/logout</A> and &quot;logout&quot;).
