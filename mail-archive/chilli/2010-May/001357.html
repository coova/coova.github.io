<PRE>Short:
Coova-Chilli 1.2.2 and current SVN have a bug in the radius packet ID
semantics which (at least for me) prevented WPA-EAP from working.

Long:
Stemming from ChilliSpot are the structures radius_t, radius_queue_t and
radius_packet_t for communication with the &quot;upstream&quot; proxy server.

(struct radius_t)-&gt;queue is an array of radius_queue_t structures, each
of which in turn contains in &quot;p&quot; a struct radius_packet_id, representing
a single RADIUS packet that is supposed to be sent to the proxy server.
radius_queue_t contains a timeout and the number of retransmissions so
far, radius_packet_id contains an &quot;id&quot; field which is of importance here.

In ChilliSpot, the array was of a fixed size, RADIUS_QUEUESIZE which was
defined as 256. The comment &quot;/* Same size as id address space */&quot;
already hinted at a simple indexing scheme used for the &quot;queue&quot; array.

Any new packet that was to be stored was prepared with
radius_default_pack():

 pack-&gt;id = 0;

When a packet was to be sent off with radius_req(), that function called
radius_queue_in() which did this:

 pack-&gt;id = this-&gt;next;
 this-&gt;next;

where this is the struct radius_t and &quot;next&quot; the next ID to be assigned.
The IDs served as indexes into &quot;queue&quot; and since &quot;next&quot; was defined as
an &quot;int&quot;, it was supposed to magically wrap around to 0, in the event
that all RADIUS_QUEUESIZE radius_queue_t slots had been used.

Now in CoovaChilli, (struct radius_t)-&gt;queue was instead implemented to
be optionally of a dynamic size below RADIUS_QUEUESIZE. Modulo operators
were used to map IDs to actual indexes.

In the process of this implementation, pack-&gt;id assignment was changed.
radius_default_pack() now does (this-&gt;next was renamed to this-&gt;qnext):

 if (this-&gt;qsize == 0)
   pack-&gt;id = this-&gt;qnext;
 else
   pack-&gt;id = /* special magic */

and radius_queue_in() no longer set pack-&gt;id itself.

This breaks the access_request() function in chilli.c: there, a
remainder of ChilliSpot origin, we read

 radius_pack.id = pack-&gt;id;

At the end radius_req() is called, which calls radius_queue_in(), which
does not set radius_pack.id itself because it expects that the value
chosen by radius_default_pack() is still there. Boom :) This gave nice
error messages &quot;No such id in radius queue&quot; resp. &quot;Matching request was
not found in queue&quot;.

Attached patch removes the offending line from access_request() and
applies to both 1.2.2 and SVN. Actually, the line seems to have served
no purpose anyway, neither in ChilliSpot nor in CoovaChilli. In
ChilliSpot, as described, radius_queue_in() overwrote pack-&gt;id anyway.
In CoovaChilli it caused the erroneous behaviour described above.

The offending line was probably copied from other functions such as
radius_access_reject(), where it is correct since radius_resp() is
subsequently called, not radius_req().

Please verify and have a nice Sunday :)
