<PRE>Hi,

Been working on a concept for a kernel module for CoovaChilli. With the
subversion code, configure with &quot;--with-nfcoova&quot; to have the module
built. With the support built in, and the xt_coova module loaded, the
idea is that authenticated traffic goes straight through the kernel and
unauthorized traffic still goes through chilli user-space - enforcing
captive portal and doing the walled garden, etc. xt_coova (which borrows
from the 'recent' module) does a simple allow/drop decision based on
authentication status. Some specific configurations are needed for this
to work. 

The iptables rules might look like this:

iptables -I FORWARD -o eth0 --src 10.0.0.0/8 \
  -m coova --name chilli -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -i eth0 --dst 10.0.0.0/8 \
  -m coova --name chilli --dest -j ACCEPT

iptables -I FORWARD --src 11.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD --dst 11.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT

(where the assumption is that the default FORWARD rule is to DENY). The
idea is that traffic to/from eth0 (WAN) from source 10.0.0.0/8 (the
chilli DHCP IP space) is either allowed or dropped by the xt_coova
module based on authentication status. The 11.0.0.0/8 network, in this
example, is the network chilli has configured for it's uamlisten. 

I should mention that when using the kernel module, I have it setup such
that the dhcpif (eth1) is actually configured with IP address 10.1.0.1
and the same IP is configured in chilli as the 'dhcplisten' (note that
typically chilli doesn't want the dhcpif interface configured with an
IP). Chilli is then also configured with 'uamlisten' of 11.0.0.1 and
this is the IP address that gets assigned to tun0 (so note that
dhcplisten and uamlisten are different!). The high level concept is that
subscribers get a 10.1.0.0/24 IP address which is routed (when
authenticated) through the kernel. Chilli still monitors all traffic on
the dhcpif and when users are not authorized yet (i.e. their 10.1.0.0/24
address is not being forwarded), then chilli does the routing (after
doing a NAT translation from 10.1.0.0/24 to 11.1.0.0/24). 

Thus, chilli basically is only routing unauthorized traffic while
authorized traffic goes straight through the kernel. With some testing
on open-mesh routers, we have seen this can drastically increase
throughput for authenticated users.

With the iptables rules above, here is an example chilli.conf that I
have been using:

cat&lt;&lt;EOF&gt;/tmp/chilli.conf
net 10.1.0.0/16
dynip 10.1.0.0/24
statip 10.1.1.0/24

uamlisten 11.1.0.1 
dhcplisten 10.1.0.1 
dhcpstart 10
uamaliasname chilli
ipup=
ipdown= 

radiusserver1 localhost
radiussecret testing123
dhcpif eth0
dns1 192.168.1.1
uamdomain coova.org
uamserver <A HREF="http://portal/hotspot">http://portal/hotspot</A>
uamsecret uamsecret
cmdsock /var/run/chilli.sock
kname chilli
EOF

Give it a try if interested in testing! 

David
