<PRE>Hi list,

The network is already built and we can't change the architecture. You can
see an example in the image attached.
When a laptop wants to get connected through an AP doing outdoor coverage,
it broadcast a DHCP discover packet that arrive to both servers because they
are in the same broadcast domain (bridged network). So, as both servers are
running Coovachilli, Coovachilli's DHCP services would respond to that with
a DHCP offer packet. Actually the first server that respond with an offer is
the one that finally configure and authenticate the host.
We have to develop a software that must run in every server, monitor its
state and the state of  the network. By a three hand shake exchange between
the servers each one decide if is optimum or not. The optimum server must be
the one that configure and authenticate the host.
Then our application must listen on port 67 to be able to control the IP
assignation. The problem is that we don't know hot to change the
Coovachilli's dhcp listening port.
Thank you in advance!

&gt;<i> Hi Jos&#233;,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any diagram of the network you are building? I don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand how you plan to have DHCP services...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, you might ask your question to the <A HREF="http://lists.coova.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/chilli">chilli at coova.org</A> mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> (after signing up for the list) as I think a few people there might be
</I>&gt;<i> doing similar things.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am part of a group of students from Uruguay that is working on their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; graduate thesis for the Plan Ceibal (implementation of the OLPC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project in Uruguay). We are trying to balance connections in a bridged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network that has several possible gateways to internet, every server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has Coovachilli running to grant access control. For that purpose, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to develop an application that must run in each server and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intercept the DHCP packets before they get to the coova dhcp server,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and then depending on the state of the server, give or not to give an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IP to the host. Meaning, if the server is the optimal one it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forward the packet to Coova DHCP server, otherwise it will discard the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packet. To be able to do that we would need to change the port where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Coovachilli is listening for DHCP packets and some firewall rules I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imagine, but we don't have any idea on how to do that. Would you be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to gibe us some guidance?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sorry for my english and hope you understand.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yours sincerely.
