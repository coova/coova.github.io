No body is responding to this ?

It goes to show that few people are using mac auth.

I remember tried using mac auth sometime ago but I almost come to a conclusion that mac auth is problematic, it's not advisable to use it in production environment, more so if mac auth is used with static IP. 

When mac auth is used with dynamic IP, the way to go about seeking re-auth is to switch off the device for such a time after which the dhcp lease is considered expired. 

However for static IP, it's impossible to expire the static IP until coova chilli is rebooted, meaning a failed static IP mac re-authentication is almost impossible.

Hi,

We are having a scenario where MacAuth clients are failing if they drop their wireless connection and re-connect again.

/etc/chilli/config has &quot;HS_MACAUTH=on&quot; and HS_MACAUTHMODE is commented out, meaning radius auth. The MAC is setup correctly in the RADHECK table with attribute='Auth-Type' and value='Accept'



The client can successfully automatically connect in the morning, but if they move to an area where their wireless connection drops and then re-established again shortly after, instead of being authenticated and having internet access they are redirected to the UAMHOMEPAGE (our login/purchase page).



Has anyone experienced/resolved this issue, or have any advice?


Thanks.

Jason
