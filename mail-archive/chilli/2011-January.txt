Hi everyone,

Is there a Radius response (to a Mac radius request) that I can send
(along with the Yea/Nay radius response) to give the DHCP address to the
client ?  (i.e. can I turn off the normal DHCP server in Coova Chilli and
handle the DHCP myself?)

I'd like to do this to try to have a persistent IP address across APs on
the same wired network

thanks,

Derek

Yes, theres is Framed-IP-Address... you can also try (svn version)
building with ./configure --enable-layer3 and run with --layer3 while
supporting your own DHCP server ready to handle requests on the tun/tap
device chilli creates.

Hi David,

Thanks very much - so Framed-IP-Address works in CoovaChilli (just like a
PPPoE setup).

That was all I needed but the --enable-layer3 options is very intriguing -
can this option work with MAC radius authentication?  I'm guessing not
because its the DHCP stage where Coova Chilli seems to look to authorise
the user against the Radius server.  Is this right or can it work somehow?

Hi Derek,

Indeed, MAC-auth in layer3 mode wouldn't make sense. While it could be
nice to authenticate a router, you wouldn't want to think that all
clients with that MAC are unique... since, again, could be a router.

I've tried the layer3 option (during compiling and running),
but dumping traffic on tun0 interface I don't see any DHCP request,
and clients do not get any ip address. I'm running dnsmasq on tun0 interface
binded to its ip address.

Turning on debugging I see:

dhcp.c: 2940: 0 (Debug) ignoring layer2 dhcp/bootps request

Do I need to enable/set any special option in configuration files
(like dhcpgateway/relay)
to use the external dhcp?

Thank you

Leonardo
