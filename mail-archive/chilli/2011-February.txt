Subject: [Chilli] DHCP Hostname with Mac Authentication
Message-ID: <56709.83.70.152.153.1297105685.squirrel@www.rivertowermail.com>

Hi all,

Is it possible to get the DHCP hostname over to the freeradius/Jradius
server during the initial radius mac authentication (when the DHCP is
being done)?

Something like a populated Attr_ChilliSpotDHCPHostname attribute would be
great (except that dumping all attributes, in JRadius, with a
req.getAttributes().toString() shows that this attribute isn't being
passed).

I know it might be possible to use a remote freeradius/Jradius DHCP server
solution but I don't think that upstream-DHCP (DHCP relay / DHCP
forwarding) works alongside mac authentication (or, at least, it says that
here: http://coova.org/node/143).

thanks for any advice!

Derek

Subject: [Chilli] Filter requests to some URL before auth
Message-ID: <AANLkTinzVoeRNFRty9+p2U=+x_YMUBQX0pMpJ5kuHBZC@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
It's been a long time since my last contribution to the list, but now we
have a problem and we need to find a solution..  David or someone else may
remember about me.

We have an scenario with about 200 hotspots with a large number of users. We
use CoovaAP in a quilte old version, but very stable so far.. so we would
like to avoid changing it. Nowadays we still use as source of the website a
perl script called hostpostlogin.cgi (i don't know if it's the used one in
current version) and we have the problem that with the huge amount of GETs
of this website, our webserver dies.

We were thinking of what to do to solve this, and we have found that about
20~40% of the get's from unauthenticated users are made by Windows Update,
or Antivirus updates or any other webservice.. and we would like to filter
them.

So there is the question, is it possible to do a kind of "walled garden" but
in the opposite way? so that the url's/IP that we set are not redirected to
the captive portal? I've made a few tests using iptables and the several
firewall files present on the firmware, but I could not set this
performance.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance.

Oriol.

I forgot to specify that we use:

And CoovaAp based on Openwrt v 0.9

You could add some of those resources into the walled garden, or you might consider using the uamhomepage feature and a simple JavaScript redirect to your portal... Chances are these programs will not follow that redirect, but browsers with eyeballs watching will..  You could also perhaps filter dns so those sites don't resolve... 

I hope all is well....

Hi Oriol, we went with a javascript redirect a few years back to solve the
same problem (~700 hotspots)

Message-ID: <201102271627.44161.serverinfo@iast.it>

We have a bunch of boxes running coova: on one of them recently coova started  
dropping connections with errors:
coova-chilli[30592]: net.c: 749: 9 (Bad file descriptor) net_write_eth(fd=-1, 
len=54) failed
Stopping and restarting coova temporarely fixes the problem; this happens  
roughly every 12~36 hours.
All the boxes runs on the same OS (Debian Squeeze) and hardware and has the 
same version of coova (1.2.5); the only difference is the affected coova has a 
high-speed connection (100Mibt) on the WAN side, but the traffic is quite low 
(rarely over 6Mbit) and I cannot find any correlation between bandwith usage 
and the problem.
Any advice if it is a software problem or hardware-related?

If you're mentioning bad file descriptors, possibly the OS simply ran out of
those
so it's unable to allocate anymore and hence the error message.

My suggestion would be to first check the status of that when this issue
occurs.
If that is the case it's easy enough to just set the value to a higher
limit.

Liran Tal.

I'll check next time it will happen, but ulimit -n is quite high (32K)

Raising loggin a also see a flood (3~4 / sec ) of another kind of error:
net.c: 114: 13 (Permission denied) ioctl(SIOCSIFFLAGS) failed
this error happens also on  other boxes, though at a lower rate

I'll try with 1.2.6

Are those errors alone, or associated with other errors in log? Upgrading is advised. Also wondering if the state of the dhcpif ever changes (upped or downed, etc).

Subject: [Chilli] coova chilli - ARP table (where is it?)
Message-ID: <58018.172.16.13.1.1298934425.squirrel@www.rivertowermail.com>

Hi all,

If I want to lookup a Coova Chilli IP to Mac address do I have to use the
coova query socket or coova query list command?

Normally this information is available in /proc/net/arp but it looks like
any clients given IP addresses, and NATted, by Coova Chilli don't populate
the system arp table.

thanks for info

Derek
