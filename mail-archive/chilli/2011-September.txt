Subject: [Chilli] [PATCH] adds possibility to disable creation of arp table
 entries when usetap is used
Message-ID: <4E6A28A2.4090801@endian.com>

hi guys

The attached patch adds the "noarpentries" option, which disables
creation of arp table entries when "usetap" is enabled.

If you put your hotspot tap device within a bridge, you do not want to
have these arp table entries created, because then they should be
created on the bridge, which does the kernel then by using normal arp
protocol.

Patch is against 2.1.6. If rebase is needed, just ask and I will do it.
