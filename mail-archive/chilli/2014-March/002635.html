<PRE>Hi. I'm currently using coova 1.2.5-1 on fedora and it has been working for
a while, but I'm beginning to notice that coova is not releasing the dhcp
at all. Instead it keeps handling ips until it reaches its final segment.

My setup is like this :

HS_NETWORK=10.1.0.0

HS_NETMASK=255.255.192.0

 and I do have a lease for an hour, but still it reaches the end of the ip
pool by 4 days of continous use. What I'm  doing is to restart the server
to force coova to start giving out ips that are at the beginning of the
netmask, because  if I just kill the service and restart it;some clients
won't renew the ip address and won't be able to browse. (I guess it has
something to do with the radius session but I'm not sure, I have tried
using the chilli_query command but the problem remains)

I know that at that moment I dont have the 500 authenticated users, but
when coova begins to assing ips from 10.1.60.X to 10.1.63.X, those users
won't even get redirected to the hotspot.And some clients don't get dhcp
from my server. My UAMALLOW setup is ok:

HS_UAMALLOW=10.1.0.0/18
Has anyone experienced this kind of issues?

I know that coova 1.3.0 is out but since it changed the format of the
iptables I haven't been able to set it up properly.

Thank you for your help
