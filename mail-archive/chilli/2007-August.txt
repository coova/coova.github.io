It seems that this is the very first message of the list.
as the mailer responded this to my request:

<chilli-index.0_2000 at coova.org>:
ezmlm-get: fatal: no messages in archive



Too bad there is no web archive of this list...

I'll document the RADIUS attributes here:
http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli/RADIUS

This is, however, one of the few areas where coova-chilli is not  
backward compatible with chillispot 1.1 (since it was forked before  
that release). I did not implement the ChilliSpot-UAM-Allowed,  
ChilliSpot-MAC-Allowed, or ChilliSpot-MAC-Interval. Instead, I had  
already created the generic ChilliSpot-Config attribute to send name/ 
value pairs as strings. The 'chilli_radconfig' utility can then be  
used to do an Administrative-Login (ServiceType) request and spits  
out chilli configs found in ChilliSpot-Config (so, you _could_  
centralize most of your chilli.conf).  Now, I am moving toward  
phasing out chilli_radconfig and plan on having chilli pick up  
configurations during its server 'Administrative-Login' session (in  
the svn version, server wide accounting stats are provided in the  
administrative-user session). But, still plan on using just  
ChilliSpot-Config and not individual attributes for each config  
parameter...

As for manual pages, I am revamping the man pages in the distribution  
and will parse them out to nicely display in the wiki too. Here is  
what I mean:

	http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli/chilli(8)

There will be more man pages to come -- even one for RADIUS  
attributes used.

Cheers,
David

Hi

I noticed that email on the list are classified as spam.
I think you should change your reverse dns from www.coova.org to 
mail.coova.org

Received: from mail.coova.org (www.coova.org [208.70.90.95])

This helps a lot for not being classified as spam.

Cool David, thanks!

Will start to try it soon.

Meanwhile I would like to continue something from the chillispot  
mailing list:


--- snip ---

Hi,

I ran into the same problem (see below).
While one client was having this problem there were other clients  
connected to this WRT at the same time using chilli having no such  
problems at all. Doing more analysis I found that the client was  
really sometimes not associated with the WRT. Seems that some clients  
disassociate for unknown reason even when they shouldn't. This client  
was probably only 5m away from the WRT. And when they re-associate  
they have to re-login - which would (in my case) not the big issue -  
the bigger issue is that because of the new IP address certain web- 
apps (gmail etc) get interrupted.

DHCP lease time is not set (=chilli standard is used). I currently  
run Coova-chilli SVN 70. The question I have:  does chilli detect  
when a client is not connected anymore using another method than the  
DHCP lease time? Because e.g. in the 3rd paragraph you can see that  
chilli released the IP only after 6 minutes (and chilli uses 10  
minutes as default I think). Is there a way to tell chilli to be more  
tolerant; i.e. to wait a little if a client will get associated again  
before releasing a DHCP address?

thanks,
lc

Subject: Freeradius + acctupdate option
Message-ID: <20070820215741.GA18336@dedalo.nexlab.it>

Just because isn't documented:

If you need to manage multiple concurrent login and you want to have 
Session-Timeout dinamically update on coovachilli when a user login
multiple time, David add an amazing option, --acctupdate, that get
the NON-standard response to acctupdate packets to radius with some
attributes, like the Session-Timeout.

But now the problem is: How to make it working with freeradius and mysql?

Well, this is how:

Firt of all, look at
http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli/WithFreeRADIUS and do the
required changes to attrs.accounting_response file.

Now, on radiusd.conf, in the module {} section, 
add this:

   attr_rewrite updatesessiontimeout {
      attribute = Session-Timeout
      searchin = reply
      searchfor = "[+ ]"
      replacewith = "%{sql:SELECT ch.Value-IF(SUM(acct.AcctSessionTime) IS NULL, 0, SUM(acct.AcctSessionTime)) \
                      FROM radcheck AS ch LEFT JOIN radacct AS acct \
                      ON acct.Username=ch.UserName AND acct.AcctSessionId!='%{Acct-Session-Id}'\
                      AND acct.AcctUniqueId!='%{Acct-Unique-Session-Id}' \
                      WHERE ch.UserName='%{User-Name}' AND ch.Attribute='Max-All-Session'"
      new_attribute = yes
      append = no
   }

Now, in the acctupdate {} section add simply updatesessiontimeout and voila', le jeux son fait!

This assume that you have Max-All-Session in radcheck table, if you have it in radgroupcheck you need to 
modify a bit the sql query.

Subject: new chilli release /  [Chillispot] Problem assigning dhcp addresses

Hi,

No, chilli does not detect AP disassociations itself (though, perhaps  
in a shell script that checks the arp table; check your crontab).

It could be that the client actually released the dhcp lease when it  
disassociated.

Thats great. Is it worth also having an archive on gmane? http://gmane.org/
I find the newsgroup view to be very useful.

No, I haven't contacted lunarpages and Jens hasn't returned e-mail in  
probably over a year... I wouldn't want to copy chillispot.org  
content (that isn't also released in the gpl distribution) without  
permission. But, I do encourage others to help in the wiki  
documentation!

Cheers,
David

Hi,

How do I configure CoovaChilli to listen at more than one interface?
Like this:


                              |eth1|-- Wireless AP1 )))  ((( Client
Internet --|eth0| CoovaChilli |eth2|-- Wireless AP2 )))  ((( Client
                              |eth3|-- Wired net ----------- Client

Hmm... you could bridge the 3 network interfaces or perhaps run 3
instances of chilli (where each could have slightly different
configurations).

Thank you for the quick answer.

if I put this 3 interfaces in one bridge I will have problems with
colision, I think.

How to run 3 instances of Chilli? It's possible with WifiDog?

One more time, thank you!

what do you mean with colision?
WRT routers use chillispot with a bridge between lan and wlan with no
problem

I have about 100 customers in each interface. They are in separate
segments exactly to prevent physical collisions (CSMA/CD).

You can just run multiple instances of chilli with different configuration
files (or command line arguments) specifying the various interfaces.  No?

I thin so. But I don't know how to do. It would create a virtual interface
(tun) for each eth?

Collisions are in the air. Once your packets go to wire, ethernet hubs 
don't exst any more. Everything is switched, including in the software 
ethernet bridge.
I don't think this will change anything between making a bridge or 
running 3 chillispot instances.

Hi,
I'm using two chilli processes bound to two interfaces on different
vlans with different IP subnets.
Pay attention to uamlisten, uamport and uamuiport options to avoid
port conflicts, start one of the two daemon with the "--conf" option
and that ought to work for you too.
Ciao
