Subject: Radius check time - possible to specify?
Message-ID: <46802.149.5.32.200.1231517516.squirrel@www.rivertowermail.com>

Hi all,

I've found that Coova Chilli works excellently with OpenWRT based APs and
freeradius on a central (Internet) server:

I'm easily able to add a user's MAC address into the radcheck and
usergroup tables and after this the user can get past my "splash screen" -
super.

BUT, and this is the reason for my post today, what I haven't worked out
is how to tell Coova Chilli to do a frequent check against the free radius
server to see if the user (by MAC) is still in there.

I'm automatically removing the user from the tables with a script that
runs on the [same server as] freeradius server.

Example: When a user tries to access the web on my Coova Chilli enabled AP
they are redirected to my splash page (because their MAC is NOT in the
free radius tables). Then they accept that they want free access and I add
them in to the free radius tables and then I send them on to their
requested Internet page. Because they [MAC] are now in the free radius
tables they ARE allowed Internet access. After 5 minutes I erase their MAC
entry from the free radius tables. HERE IS THE CRUNCH: I notice that you
may still have, say, 1 hour on the Internet even though their MAC is no
longer in the free radius tables.

I'm guessing that this is because Coova Chilli is just not often
re-checking against the free radius server that the user should still get
access?

Does anyone know how to tune this in Coova Chilli?


thanks very much!!!


Derek

Hi Derek,
Normally when accounting for usage, you set an Acct-Update-Interval
variable. Not sure if this applies though in your setup, as you're not doing
accounting. But it's the first place I'd look.

Hi Henk,

I'll give that directive a try.

Actually I am accounting [or, rather, it does accounting by default - at
least data is being written into the radacct table although the write
interval is whatever default coova chilli is going for].

Out of interest I've just checked the table now:  It looks like for a
given user [MAC addr] I can see that the radacct records are being written
every 70 minutes (funny figure isn't it?).

I'll see what happens if I can adjust the radius accounting times

thanks,

Derek

If you are provisioning access with a time limit, you should be setting
the Session-Timeout attribute in your Access-Accept. It should be the
"time remaining" - a dynamic variable based on time allowed minus time
consumed (take from radacct).

Subject: Packet of death not causing proper session termination?
Message-ID: <496C85A3.1040607@gmail.com>

Hi there,

We just came across a peculiar problem whose solution is not clear to 
me: Customer logs in, gets a very long (or non-existing/infinite) 
session timeout and happily surfs away happily. Now something special 
happens and we need to terminate his session prematurely. I know I can 
do that with a packet of death sent directly to the nas on its coaport, 
BUT, I've noticed that this makes the NAS close the session only *in its 
internal state* and doesn't send an Accounting-Stop packet back to 
radius to update session parameters (most noteably input&output octets). 
I know I can close the session *on the database* manually but I 
obviously lose those up-to-date session parameters.

So, how can solve this dilemna? It would be nice to be able to force 
chilli to terminate the session properly upon receiving a packet of death...

Gunther

Subject: privileges
Message-ID: <1231867711.6866.141.camel@germaine.lapiole.org>

Hi.

I use coova-chilli on some servers and I'm quite happy with it.

But there's one *huge* security issue with it: it must runs as root.
I'm realy not very found of daemon listening on a public interface with
root privileges.
I understand coova daemon must start with root privileges as it has to
create a tun interface, configure the real one etc... but, I think it
should then drop the privileges to another user (just like openvpn do
for example).

Additionnaly, the daemon could be chrooted in a directory.

Is there a way to do this, or is something like this a planed feature ?

Cheers, Daniel

Hey,

It seems that HS_UAMALLOW always contain the URLs coova.org,
www.internet-wifi.com.ar, x-wrt.org,openwrt.org
and it seems there's no configuration to remove these or put any others in
the GUI (web gui for OpenWRT/X-WRT),
where are options these modified?

look in /etc/chilli and create your own file named "config" which will then
be used to create main.conf vua the start/stop scripts
variables available are in default, which contains the "default" setting for
coova.org

First thing I did was to change that file (/etc/chilli/config) for the
UAM_ALLOW config option that I would like but
that didn't do the trick when I restarted chilli.
