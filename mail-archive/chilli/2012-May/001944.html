<PRE> Hello,

thanks for the answers. 

K&#246;szi Gerg&#337; a gyors v&#225;laszt Neked is.

I have found all that things yet. But I would like to get the host name before radius authentication. I mean as soon as the dchp part gave ip to the client I want to store client information.

I went through the interesting part of the code and my plan is to receive the required information in the cb_dhcp_request(...) part.
Here I have a connection yet I can use for this.

And do you mean that I can simple implement the following steps?
*create radius message to fill that attributes
*add attributes to that (client ip and host name or anything else)
*call radius-req to send the radius message via the given connection
*call radius response to receive the date
*get attribute from that to save them into a file or store everywhere else

It seems be the perfect solution (or at least good) as I think. Please tell me what do you think about my plan? Is it good direction?

ps. I see in the chilli.c the cb_radius_auth_conf fnc that if radius is enabled the code asks for domain name. but it is not called if I have only dhcp connection as I checked the log file

Hello,
 
 These features are indeed implemented, and work well. Use the
 --dhcpradius option (and compile with --enable-dhcpradius, which is the
 default) and use --macauth. 
 
 Attributes in chilli C are defined in src/radius_chillispot.h
 
 Cheers,
 David

 &gt; Hi Tam&#225;s,
 &gt; 
 &gt; David wrote an article about using vendor-specific attributes to be
 &gt; able to get the DHCP options from the clients (including the client's
 &gt; hostname):
 &gt; 
 &gt; <A HREF="http://www.coova.org/node/118">http://www.coova.org/node/118</A>
 &gt; 
 &gt; I don't know if it's still a proposal or has been implemented already,
 &gt; but taking a quick look at the source tells me the proposed DHCP
 &gt; attributes are already included in the dictionary file:
 &gt; 
 &gt; <A HREF="http://dev.coova.org/svn/coova-chilli/doc/dictionary.chillispot">http://dev.coova.org/svn/coova-chilli/doc/dictionary.chillispot</A>
 &gt; 
 &gt; On the other hand, it seems the code does not use these attributes
 &gt; anywhere, so I think you will need to change the source to get the
 &gt; hostname as a RADIUS access request attribute.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Unfortunately, I'm not good enough at C++ programming to do the
 &gt; coding, but basically you just need to fetch the hostname from the
 &gt; DHCP request (DHCP option 12), store it in a property and pass it to
 &gt; the RADIUS server when sending an access request packet during
 &gt; authentication.
 &gt;

 &gt; &gt; Hello All,
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; I would like to get the host name of the connected client. My plan was
 &gt; &gt; simple modify the source code of chilli, but as I suppose it is not the best
 &gt; &gt; way and anyway I have not idea how to do this. But I went ahead and I got
 &gt; &gt; deeper and deeper in this topic. Now I find that radius server perfectly can
 &gt; &gt; solve my problem. It is almost very good news, but I do not know how to
 &gt; &gt; receive the wished attributes from that. Maybe someone can give me some
 &gt; &gt; advice how I can do this.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; But I simple do not understand why the dhcp part cannot prove this
 &gt; &gt; information. I think where I use dhcp server I want to know about client
 &gt; &gt; there. And I do not want to depend on something else. But maybe this is only
 &gt; &gt; my consideration.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; But the main point is now I would be really glad of getting some help in
 &gt; &gt; question of getting hostname. :)
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; Nice day,
 &gt; &gt;
