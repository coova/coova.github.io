Subject: [Chilli] coova hotspot setup help
Message-ID: <CAC-LwPMLn2Jrv_sDLbBZ73C-bunqBmMp5qKG2hsJ9hQSmjKYUA@mail.gmail.com>

First let me say this is absolutely the first time I'm attempting to
setup a hotspot.
I believe I have the appropriate hardware to accomplish this:
DockStar loaded w/ Debian Squeeze - the?CoovaChilli server
Linksys WRT54GS v4 - the CoovaAP server

I found this tutorial at
http://linux.xvx.cz/2010/03/debian-wi-fi-hotspot-using-coovachilli-freeradius-mysql-and-daloradius/

Am I correct in assuming I can follow that tutorial to setup
CoovaChilli on the dockstar, then setup CoovaAP on my Linksys and
integrate the two?
I cannot find any tutorials or docs on how to intergrate the two,
perhaps someone could enlighten me. Thanks in advance.

With the "any ip" option the main network setting wouldn't really
matter as long as the IPs are routed?  Do they need a route for the
UAMLISTEN IP or will Chilli handle that?

So using "any ip" combined with the layer 3 option, I should be able
to give out IPs from multiple IP blocks using another DHCP server and
have those IPs work through Chilli?  If that is the case, it should
work for what I need.  Thank you.

Is it possible for Chilli to fill in the the "called-station-id" in
freeradius with the MAC address of the access point the user connects to?
If not freeradius, does coova radius have support for this?  Currently all
I see in called-station-id is the MAC of the chilli server's eth0 interface.

There might be... what are you using for your access points?

If it supports a RADIUS MAC authentication, then it can be proxied
through chilli where the option --locationcopycalled - "Copy
Called-Station-Id from proxy RADIUS" is used. This can also be used, for
example, when having hostapd hanging the AP (using RADIUS accounting).

That sounds worth exploring. Is there any more documentation around this
that you might be able to point me to?

If only there were more time or motivation ... ;) 

It's in the changelog and only in svn. It is part of the overall
proxyvsa structure where chilli can gain ap information based on RADIUS
or DHCP. I'd suggest looking into all the "proxy" options (chilli
--help|grep -i proxy) for details.

I think we would be happy to contribute a wiki page on the coova site about
this if you could help me a bit more.

If I understand you correctly, I can start chilli with the
--locationcopycalled option.  This will tell chilli to copy the mac address
of the AP sent to chilli by the Radius MAC Authentication method into the
calledstationid of the radius server I have set for HS_RADIUS.

Is that about right?  From what you have said, it does not sound like I
need to be running CoovaRADIUS for this to work.

Thanks David,

Chris

Hi list,

Without the fix, string user_password ends at REDIR_MD5LEN, so strcmp
won't work.

I attached the patch as attachment.

Subject: [Chilli] iptables rules for transparent proxy
Message-ID: <CACqstRUqfp-BDs8ny=bovruA27QG2zoeJRtM4B1TeOPfmrxzbw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I was hoping to post this to http://coova.org/node/2917
but failed to register to the forum, so, here it goes:

iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j MARK --set-mark 0x1

iptables -t nat -I prerouting_lan \! -d $(uci get network.lan.ipaddr)
-p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8081

iptables -I input_chilli -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8081 -m mark --mark 0x1 -j ACCEPT

Some notes:

- This works with OpenWrt, but could be easily modified to suit other needs.

- My proxy listens at port 8081.

- This differs from HS_POSTAUTH_PROXYPORT because 1) I want to use
proxy before & after auth because I want to save the upload bandwidth
of the server coova redirected to, and 2) I don't want to open proxy
port to the user, because they can simply use it to bypass the captive
portal. The post I refer to (http://coova.org/node/2917) suggest doing
it in WAN, which can also work as long as we use the updated WAN ip
every time.

- Some scripts in the original post don't work anymore because DROP
can't be used in NAT table now.

Regards,
John

should be:

Subject: [Chilli] Coova with no authentication
Message-ID: <4ED4F7FE.2060704@cirrusworks.net>

I've gotten a request to setup a Coova instance with no splash page
authentication. The primary goal is to rate limit users based on Radius
settings. I've tried to find example of how to do this, but haven't had
any luck so far. Is this possible?

Subject: [Chilli] Infinite redirect loop
Message-ID: <4ED4F683.1020202@cirrusworks.net>

I've seen a problem with some of my Coova installations where I get an
infinite redirect loop, typically after a RADIUS timeout and the user is
still making web requests. This happens if there is a WISPr Redirect URL
set and the user tries to log back in after the timeout. What seems to
be happening is the initial redirect to the UAM page (which is offsite)
is being replaced with the previously assigned WISPr Redirect URL. For
example when printing out my redirect url in the logs, it looks like:

http://my.wispr.redirect.com/?loginurl=http%3a%2f%2my.uam.authentication.com%2fhotspotlogin.php

Since my.wispr.redirect.com is not allowed yet in this session(radius
timeout has occured and I'm logged out), I am redirected again, and
again, and again. I should be redirected to
http://my.uam.authentication.com, but it looks like something is getting
crossed.

I've had this problem across several versions (1.2.2, 1.2.5 and 1.2.8)
and I've been working on it with 1.2.8. After some experimentation, I've
made a change in redir.c on line ~4035(I've added extra debugging):

-    char * base_url = (conn.s_params.flags & REQUIRE_REDIRECT &&
-                       conn.s_params.url[0]) ? (char
*)conn.s_params.url : redir->homepage;
+    char * base_url = redir->homepage;


This doesn't cause any redirection issues, and I can't simulate the
infinite redirection loop any more. However, I'm not very familiar with
the code so I'm not sure if this has any undesirable side effects that I
just haven't seen yet.

Has anyone else seen this problem? What am I losing by change the
conditional when determining the base url?

Subject: [Chilli] bug in dhcp.c ???
Message-ID: <CAL-yc89Y8pnKUACn1b4b1BpkJ+90aYtkxcV1DXjbHcaBV9eqwg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm cross-compiling coova-chilli (v1.2.7) for a mips platform.  This
tool chain defaults to -O3 and during the compile it fails on:

dhcp.c:3113: error: ?conn? may be used uninitialized in this function

If I change the optimization level to -O2, then it compiles but it
does look like a real bug to me (although unlikely to hit that error
condition).

In dhcp.c::dhcp_receive_ip() we have:

  struct dhcp_conn_t *conn;                 <=== uninitialized pointer
  struct in_addr ourip;
  struct in_addr addr;

  char do_checksum = 0;
  char allowed = 0;
  char has_ip = 0;
  char is_dhcp = 0;

  int authstate = 0;

#ifdef ENABLE_LAYER3
  struct app_conn_t *appconn = 0;
#endif

  if (len < PKT_IP_HLEN + PKT_ETH_HLEN + 4)
    return 0;

  /*
   *  Only supports IPv4 currently.
   */
  if (pack_iph->version_ihl != PKT_IP_VER_HLEN) {
#if(_debug_)
    log_dbg("dropping non-IPv4");
#endif
    return 0;
  }

  /*
   * Sanity check on IP total length
   */
  if ((int)ntohs(pack_iph->tot_len) + sizeofeth(pack) > len) {
    uint8_t icmp_pack[PKT_BUFFER];
    struct dhcp_t *this = conn->parent;
<== dereference unitialized pointer



Any thoughts?
