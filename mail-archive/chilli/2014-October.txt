Subject: [Chilli] chilli no-internet problem
Message-ID: <1413306965.18212.YahooMailNeo@web192705.mail.sg3.yahoo.com>

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone encountered this issue before. My computer is not able to connect to the internet when trying to authenticate from a router managed by chilli if the router was booted initially without connection to the internet. For clarity, below is the process that causes the said problem.

1. Router boots with NO Internet connection( i.e WAN source is off or not available)
2. After a few minutes... Router now has internet connection (WAN source is ON or is available)
3. User logs in to the wireless network, managed by coova-chilli
4. NO INTERNET CONNECTION ( i.e No captive portal redirect, no DNS; pinging google would result to a failure)

Im guessing the problem occurs when coova boots without internet connection. Have anyone encountered this problem in the past?

The setup is this, coova-chilli on OpenWRT 12.09.


Cheers!

Subject: [Chilli] uam redirect fail
Message-ID: <02bb01cfebf1$9d3b7940$d7b26bc0$@sanitycomputers.com.au>

Using coova-chilli 1.2.8 on the Cloudtrax Openwrt ng firmware (and the
previous Robin firmware) I have found an odd bug.  Some users are not been
redirected to the radius UAM server. The redirect page and logo just stops
and eventually the browser times out.

 

You would think that the uam server was not accessible, but the same user
has http access to the UAM server. The most common device to have the issue
is a Samsung tablet, and often IOS devices. It does not seem to happen on
most other OS's.

 

I have considered DNS as the problem but not sure how to debug and http
access is available anyway.  If the user had there 3g modem on at the same
time there may be a conflict with the wifi..  It seems more likely something
to do with the built in handler for wifi hotspot captive portals. 

 

This page shows a great run down on captive portal issues,
http://help.tanaza.com/customer/portal/articles/1317023-captive-portal-autom
atic-detection-avoid-login-popups  

 

But this specific problem does not show the captive portal popup at all, it
simply times out, sometimes a reboot will fix the next redirect but normally
I need to log them in via mac auth. 

 

I've seen many coova-chilli redirect threads but not specifically like this.

 

 

Regards 


Jim
