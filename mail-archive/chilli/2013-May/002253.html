<PRE>Hi David,

We use coova on OpenWRT and set up a bridged interface between 2 different
SSID's we've created which are bound to a VLAN we've created to keep them
separate from the LAN.

We also allocate port 4 on the back of the router to this VLAN so that
customers can plug in their own access points/devices and be routed through
coova in the same way as when they go through the wifi. This works perfectly
if we can separate the AP's they have in to its own switch and then in to
port 4 on our router.

We're now facing a problem in that if a customer has multiple devices
plugged in to the switch, or if they have one cable feeding the switch, then
AP's and internal devices fed from that switch, all traffic would be routed
through coova.

So, is there a way we can set OpenWRT/coova to check the VLAN ID that is
passed from an external switch/AP and route the traffic through coova or
not, depending on this VLAN ID?

This would also allow us to split any SSID's we have in to their own VLAN so
we can have one for guest access and the other for private use (WPA2'd).

Thanks,

James
