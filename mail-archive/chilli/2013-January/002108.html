By running a single instance of chilli. I wouldn't run it on an AP,
rather on a PC (appliance) where you have all your APs bridge into. This
way, you can use unmodified standard AP hardware/firmware and
subscribers will even maintain their same IP across APs. 

&gt;<i> Ok, my scenario: 5 APs in the area, connected to the same LAN, remote AAA,
</I>&gt;<i> chilli running on every AP. Now if the client gets authenticated via UAM on
</I>&gt;<i> say AP1 and roams(losts coverage from AP1) to the AP2, then coova-chilli
</I>&gt;<i> instance running on AP2 doesn't have this user amongst authenticated users, so
</I>&gt;<i> user has to authenticate in UAM again.  Which is quite cumbersome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Using MAC authentication, with the appropriate logic in your RADIUS
server, you can have subscribers automatically logged into chilli when
they move to a new chilli instance. 

&gt;<i> One of the solutions(also proposed by the Emanuele) is to have only one chilli
</I>&gt;<i> instance, which would be common for the rest of the APs in the network, but
</I>&gt;<i> this has the drawback, that it's a single point of failure. So if this AP with
</I>&gt;<i> coova-chilli instance running goes down, whole network is inaccessible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I see the &quot;cluster&quot; feature in my use case, if the user gets authenticated
</I>&gt;<i> via UAM on AP1, AP1 would broadcast this event, say by NEW_AUTH_USER command
</I>&gt;<i> to other coova-chilli instances running on the network (with same shared
</I>&gt;<i> secret + session information) and if the user then roams(moves away from
</I>&gt;<i> coverage of AP1) to say AP2 in the network, then AP2 would already have this
</I>&gt;<i> user's session information and would just allow him to use the network. So in
</I>&gt;<i> this scenario, there's no single point of failure. It's kind of the
</I>&gt;<i> poor-mans's failover.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The problem there is that if each AP is running chilli, they are not
really on the same broadcast network -- each chilli has it's own local
network. 

&gt;<i> Thanks.
