<PRE>Hi list,
i want to understand the meaning of following directive when compiling
coovachilli. I tried to google but could not get some results explaining
that.

./configure --enable-layer3

Does this mean if I compiled using this switch, coovachilli cannot be used as
layer2 model anymore, Such as multi tenant, Mac authentication &amp; vlans? And
chilli would be configure for L3. Actually we may use L3 model in future
but L2 for now, need clarification about the switch

Thanks for attending to it.
