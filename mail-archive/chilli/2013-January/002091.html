<PRE>My Greetings to Coova-Chilli Community,

Question about Covva-Chilli, i am new to Captive Portal concept, but i am
working on the Linux O/S for sometime now . i need help with respect to
Coova-Chilli captive portal. i managed to get the following working.

1.) Freeradius with rlm_sqlcounters such as &quot;sql_bandwidth_counter&quot;,
&quot;sql_traffic_quota_counter&quot;  &quot;dailycunter&quot;, &quot;noresetcounter&quot; etc..

2.) Daloradius to manage backend implementation of Freeradius &amp; MySQL.

3.) Coova-Chilli up and running, displaying login page and login
successfully using Freeradious Vouchers, some basic attributes are also
working using mysql counter (MAX-DAILYS-ESSIONS &amp; MAX-ALL-SESSION etc..)

4.) This is Ubuntu Server X64 12.4 LTS - Installation

Please i need the help for some advance configuration and attributes, i
would ask two questions, i afraid if my question would be correct, please
somebody help me

I don't have some fronted web interface to manage coova-chilli
implementation, such as, to view live used, kill connection etc. i have
come across the few JSON &amp; YFi Manager.  i would like to seek advice for
the one that offers more flexibility and control to be used.


Is it possible to configure Covva-Chilli build in DHCP server to issue ip
address from multiple subnets to the clients. Such as, IP to HostSpot-A
from the range of 172.31.43.0 -  172.31.43.254 subnet And IP to HotSpot-B
from the rang of 41.232.222.0 subnet, like that? if someone can indicate
the directive, i am willing to study about it.

i.e. we have two hotspots A &amp; B, we do not want vouchers to work across the
hotspots. Vouchers for HotSpot-A Should be Invalid at HotSpot-B) should
not allow to login. that means username/password somehow should be bounded
with the pool ip address (Perhaps With FreeRadius Attribute Using Group /
Profile). i want help to understand how that can logically work,


*PERHAPS, *

HotSpot-A = VLAN-ID: 10

configuring coova-chilli that when the dhcp request packet coming from VLAN
_ID:10 then ip should be issued from specific pool such as from from
172.31.43.0 subnet

HotSpot-B = VLAN-ID: 20

configuring coova-chilli that when the dhcp request packet coming from VLAN
_ID:20 then ip should be issued from specific pool such as from from
41.232.222.0 subnet

Why i am doing so because i do not want vouchers from Hotspot-A should work
at Hotspot-B

i want to make sure that perhaps there is better way to achieve that i am
overlooking. Is anyone managed to get that kind of environment working, i
want their opinion? There is unclear logical picture in the mind, looking
assistance for the clarity from the community friends. Below i am trying to
put little different way for same understanding incase i could not put my
question well.


Kindly help, how this scenario can work? conclusion of above question.

Guys, we have two hot spots, need coova-chilli dhcp server to configure
such as way that it should issue the ip address from the specified subnet
according to the VLAN (perhaps), if any other logic can be used please
advice. reason i am doing this because we do not want vouchers to work
across the hot spots. Voucher for the hotspot A should be invalid at
hotspot B, if this can be achieved any other way, your advice mean to me,
thanks for attending to this materiel.

Regards
