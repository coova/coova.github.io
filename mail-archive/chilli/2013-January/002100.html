<PRE>&quot;Roaming&quot; can mean several things here. As correctly pointed out, it is
routine to allow for roaming authentication through standard RADIUS
practices - typically using 802.1x or mac authentication on UAM network.
You could also have roaming between APs where the same chilli session is
maintained where the APs bridge into the same network. However, that is
separate from the clustering feature, which is designed to provide fault
tolerance. The feature is not complete and has only been experimented
with (with encouraging results). The concept is to have multiple
instance of chilli synchronized and able to assume control over the
network segment should the primary instance fail.
