Subject: [Chilli]  CoovaChilli on NethServer
Message-ID: <54056C06.1010403@nethesis.it>

Hi all!

We have made the rpm package of CoovaChilli for NethServer (see 
http://dev.nethserver.org/issues/2782 on NethServer tracker).

NethServer is an operating system for Linux enthusiasts, designed for 
small offices and medium enterprises (http://www.nethserver.org/).

Subject: [Chilli] 802.1X - EAP/TLS Authentication using coova as Radius proxy
Message-ID: <1409851870842.43939@et.esiea.fr>

Dear CoovaChilli users,


I'm trying to do 802.1X (wired/ and wireless with wpa) authentication using EAP-TLS method which involve mutual authentication with certificates (both sides client/server).


I already succeed to 802.1X EAP-PEAP authentication but I'm having trouble with EAP-TLS.


I configured chilli as proxy radius with the parameters below :

--proxylisten

--proxyport

--proxyclient

--proxysecret


Here is my authentication chain link:

Supplicant wpa_supplicant <-> switch Alcatel <-> coovachilli <-> freeradius server


So, the dialog between the supplicant and freeradius is doing well until

freeradius ask for client certificate. At this moment the switch interrupt

the authentication process. ( I got the same with wireless authentication using

Alcatel omniaccess AP)


I checked with wireshark the frames between freeradius <->coova<-> switch :

the radius packet from freeradius (Access-challenge) containing certificate request is forwarded to

the switch properly.


Frames between supplicant <-> switch

When client certificate is requested the supplicant send the first eap fragment which contains

the client certificate but it's "dropped" by the switch and it displays "Radius server not reachable"


To resume the situation here is the radius packets exchange :

switch <-----------------------------------> freeradius

--------> Access-Request: identity

<-------- Access-Challenge : Start TLS

---------> Access-Request: Client Hello

<-------- Access-Challenge : Server Hello, Certificate Request


And then nothing happens :(


Please help me if anyone have suggestion or explanation about this strange behaviour.


Thanks for all the reply, all the best.


Olivier

Hi,
i had the same problem. I think the suitable solution is to enable a 
provisional session to do this kind of authorization. Facebook uses many 
servers so enabling the only facebook.com domain would not be the clear 
path..

Hm, I have squid package running on a 64MB flash system, using about 12MB RAM. Could be smaller, in case of reducing cache_mem, and recompile, to remove unnecessary components.

	proxy [SOLVED]

Hi everyone,

I solved the EAP-TLS authentication issue.

The length of packets sent by wpa_supplicant was too big (1408 bytes).

Indeed, when the radius client encapsulates EAP message in a radius packet (Access-Request), total length of radius packet was greater than 1500 bytes.

Thus coovaChilli dropped these packets.

To fix that, I just configure my supplicant to make fragments of 1024 bytes.

Here is my configuration of wpa_supplicant, maybe it can be useful to somebody :
# EAP-TLS wired authentication

    network={

            eapol_flags=0

            key_mgmt=WPA-EAP

            eap=TLS

            identity="yourID"

            ca_cert="path/to/ca_certificate
            client_cert="path/to/client_certificate"

            private_key="path/to/client_private_key

            private_key_passwd="yourPassword"

            fragment_size=1024

    }


Finally, I would like to thanks coovaChilli developers for their work. It's a great project and for me the best network access controller.

Best regards,

Subject: [Chilli] [Chillispot] Redirection problem with DD-WRT
Message-ID: <54268D29.3090707@gmail.com>

Hi guys,

    Please apologize me for having to put into discussions the defuncted
Chillispot but this is a forced corner case for me.

    With router TP-Link TL-WR740N (see [1] for hardware details), I've
installed DD-WRT image for WR740N (v24 PreSP2 Beta Build 21061).
    Trying to get chillispot to work, so here goes some information my
setup (please bare with me):

FreeRADIUS side (on CentOS, firewall disabled allows incoming, SELinux
not enforcing):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Type: other
2. clients allow 0.0.0.0/0
3. secret is configured to be the same with hotspotlogin.cgi (chillispot
doc/) for test purposes
4. local radius test login works fine (both accept & reject)
5. remote radius test (from dd-wrt) works fine from bash
6. when dd-wrt should redirect the user there's no incoming data on the
WAN interface of the server (ping however is seen and is working; so
this rules out connectivity issues)


DD-WRT most important:

A summary first: this router is intended to be deployed in production
behind an ADSL router, so it will serve Hotspot and will use the
upstream router as a gateway.

A. Networking side
------------------
i. Config type: Gateway

ii. WAN is static in Gateway's LAN (router ip: 192.168.1.2/24, gw:
192.168.1.254 -> this is the ADSL)

iii. DHCP disabled

iv. br0: eth0 ("WAN" - to ADSL router) + eth1 (LAN)

v. br1: ath0.1 + ath0 (wireless iface; ath0.1 is the hotspot one which
announces its bssid to the public and is free; ath0 is for management
purposes, passwd protected)

vi. firewall is disabled; connectivity is fine (dns as well); all
interfaces are set bridged (Setup > Networking); brctl is ok (see iv and
v above)

vii. tun0 is created by chilli and serves dhcp for its subnet as well
(192.168.182.0/24); running in debug mode i can see it serves dhcp
leases so is fine

viii. the client that gets the lease has chilli (192.168.182.1) as
gateway, first ip for client is from range: .2-.254/24 (OK) and dns
works correctly (can resolve google.ro for example); pinging also works

ix. iptables is reflecting the rules from firewall.openwrt[2]
(chillispot doc/); once I remove masquerade on postrouting however in
nat table, connectivity for client is cut; it seems is bypassing chilli
somehow

So last: x. redirection issue: the client gets the lease, but when it
will browse is just completely bypassing chilli altogether. Chilli gives
the lease, and i can see the traffic (tcpdump) but the browser is not
redirected to hotspotlogin.cgi (centos tcpdump doesn't prompt anything
so is like chilli never got the traffic in the first place).

How can chilli be bypassed since it is the gateway and should capture
all traffic from the client? Could it be that once chilli gives the
lease then traffic bypasses from br1 to br0 without going via tun0?

Tried in debug mode, nothing of interest just the lease (chilli -d -f -c
/tmp/chilli/chilli.conf). Could be the forward rules that are not blocking?

Any suggestions? Much appreciated!

Thanks a lot,
Alex

I've fixed this by not having br1 and tun0 overlapping.

tun0 (chilli listen) is now on 192.168.182.0/24

while br1 is on different network: 192.168.183.0/24

what was happening was taht once chilli served the dhcp request for the
client, he would go out via br1 to br0 and internet bypassing chilli
completely.

indeed this happened, it was not going through chilli after the lease
anymore
