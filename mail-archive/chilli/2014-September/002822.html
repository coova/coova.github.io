<PRE>Hi guys,

    Please apologize me for having to put into discussions the defuncted
Chillispot but this is a forced corner case for me.

    With router TP-Link TL-WR740N (see [1] for hardware details), I've
installed DD-WRT image for WR740N (v24 PreSP2 Beta Build 21061).
    Trying to get chillispot to work, so here goes some information my
setup (please bare with me):

FreeRADIUS side (on CentOS, firewall disabled allows incoming, SELinux
not enforcing):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Type: other
2. clients allow 0.0.0.0/0
3. secret is configured to be the same with hotspotlogin.cgi (chillispot
doc/) for test purposes
4. local radius test login works fine (both accept &amp; reject)
5. remote radius test (from dd-wrt) works fine from bash
6. when dd-wrt should redirect the user there's no incoming data on the
WAN interface of the server (ping however is seen and is working; so
this rules out connectivity issues)


DD-WRT most important:

A summary first: this router is intended to be deployed in production
behind an ADSL router, so it will serve Hotspot and will use the
upstream router as a gateway.

A. Networking side
------------------
i. Config type: Gateway

ii. WAN is static in Gateway's LAN (router ip: 192.168.1.2/24, gw:
192.168.1.254 -&gt; this is the ADSL)

iii. DHCP disabled

iv. br0: eth0 (&quot;WAN&quot; - to ADSL router) + eth1 (LAN)

v. br1: ath0.1 + ath0 (wireless iface; ath0.1 is the hotspot one which
announces its bssid to the public and is free; ath0 is for management
purposes, passwd protected)

vi. firewall is disabled; connectivity is fine (dns as well); all
interfaces are set bridged (Setup &gt; Networking); brctl is ok (see iv and
v above)

vii. tun0 is created by chilli and serves dhcp for its subnet as well
(192.168.182.0/24); running in debug mode i can see it serves dhcp
leases so is fine

viii. the client that gets the lease has chilli (192.168.182.1) as
gateway, first ip for client is from range: .2-.254/24 (OK) and dns
works correctly (can resolve google.ro for example); pinging also works

ix. iptables is reflecting the rules from firewall.openwrt[2]
(chillispot doc/); once I remove masquerade on postrouting however in
nat table, connectivity for client is cut; it seems is bypassing chilli
somehow

So last: x. redirection issue: the client gets the lease, but when it
will browse is just completely bypassing chilli altogether. Chilli gives
the lease, and i can see the traffic (tcpdump) but the browser is not
redirected to hotspotlogin.cgi (centos tcpdump doesn't prompt anything
so is like chilli never got the traffic in the first place).

How can chilli be bypassed since it is the gateway and should capture
all traffic from the client? Could it be that once chilli gives the
lease then traffic bypasses from br1 to br0 without going via tun0?

Tried in debug mode, nothing of interest just the lease (chilli -d -f -c
/tmp/chilli/chilli.conf). Could be the forward rules that are not blocking?

Any suggestions? Much appreciated!

Thanks a lot,
Alex
