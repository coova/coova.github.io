<PRE>Hi,I have openwrt + coova chilli running on DLink DIR505. Everything is working great. Now i want to configure another same router as repeater. So i configured my repeater as bridged client. I can connect to the repeater and got an IP of 192.168.182.xxx which is what coova is providing from main router. Splash page appears and i was able to login. Everything was perfect till i tried connecting another device. This time repeater did not ask me for login but allowed me the internet.
my configuration is -
ADSL modem(192.168.1.1)&#160;---&gt; (192.168.1.9) main router (192.168.182.xx) ----&gt;&#160;(192.168.182.99 -static device IP)&#160;repeater&#160;(192.168.182.xx)----&gt; laptop/iPad/mobile
On further investigation i found that coovachilli is asking for login only to the first client who attempt to connect and not for subsequent clients. My repeater is behind main AP and i am using relays for creating a bridge between main AP and repeater. Can someone please let me know how can i fix this? Being a bridged client coova shouldn't consider everyone from same station.
Cheers!!&#160;
