<PRE>Hi,

I'm experiencing strange issues, while using the latest version of
Coova-Chilli. I can log in successfully, but right after that, my session
gets dropped, so I have to log in again. On the RADIUS server, I see
User-Request as the reason of disconnecting... This happens all the time,
the requested site starts to load, but after some seconds, the session ends
unexpectedly. Starting Chilli in debug mode tells me the following:

dhcp.c: 1938: 0 (Debug) Dropping session due to request for auto-logout ip

Why does this happen? What is that auto-logout ip, at all?

Some details about my config: Ubuntu 8.04/CoovaChilli 1.0.12, installed by
using the Debian package version 1.0.12-1. I'm on a virtual machine, which
has two virtual interfaces, eth0 and eth1, each one connects to separate
vlans on the host system (vlan11 and vlan12). Using the same configuration
on a virtual machine which has a real, bridged interface (eth0) and one vlan
(vlan23) configured as the LAN interface works with no issues at all. I
don't know too much about the internals of CoovaChilli, but I'm pretty sure,
that this bug is around VLANs. Are VLANs supported by Chilli, at all?

I could manage to have a working captive portal system by installing the
latest ChilliSpot version (1.1), but I would like to use some features which
are only included in CoovaChilli.

I greatly appreciate any help, because I'm completely out of ideas.

Best regards:
Gergely Kiss
