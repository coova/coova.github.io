<PRE>Then, the issues isn't that chilli is handling DHCP wrongly. The real
issue is that your subscribers are NAT'ed (in layer 2) such that chilli
would not see the true MAC of the subscriber. This is fundamentally a
problem with chilli - even if DHCP was operating as you expected. 

I believe 'sweetspot' might be more what you are looking for. From what
I understand, it is like chilli only for layer 3.
