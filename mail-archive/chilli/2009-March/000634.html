<PRE>It might be good timing then, for CoovaChilli to start expanding beyond
PAP and CHAP. To that end, I added some MS-CHAPv2 features into the SVN
version. Support for MS-CHAPv2 comes in two flavors:

- In the chilli logon URL, it already looks for a 'password' (encoded
p/w for PAP) or a 'response' (for CHAP), and now accepts
'ntresponse' (for MS-CHAPv2). This will allow the portal to format a
MS-CHAPv2 Response to have chilli send through. 

- An option 'mschapv2' which will use MS-CHAPv2 instead of PAP for
authentication where the logon URL is sent a 'password'. For the
additional crypto, started to use OpenSSL (optional during configure) -
which might allow for additional features too. 

Question, comments, or bug reports please reply to chilli's list. 

cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unavailable. But, in another networks and environments, the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocol might be very suitable or the only option available. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   There are very, very, few places where CHAP is suitable.  They mostly
