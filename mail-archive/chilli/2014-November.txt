Message-ID: <CAMN68dPLPi4_4w3=HwsrEmCjrsKFiADLBXiF-HJLJt3f1VodKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

I want some help in doing the following:

> Users redirected to remotely hosted Splash Page
> Users click on " I Agree" button and then internet access is allowed
> no radius, just splash, click and go.

this should be quite basic for you all, i am just a new comer
kindly show me the right direction to make this happen. Thanks!
p.s. chillisplash could be a different project for users like me..similar
to nocatsplash.

Subject: [Chilli] Assign ip to HS_LANIF interface
Message-ID: <5458FAD2.7020502@nethesis.it>

The coova chilli init script removes the ip address from HS_LANIF interface.
Anyone experiments any side effects by assigning an ip to the HS_LANIF 
interface (commenting "ifconfig $HS_LANIF 0.0.0.0" line)? Is that a good 
practice?

HS_LANIF interface shouldn't have any ip assigned to it, it's merely
used as an interface to the kernel in order to capture the traffic (tun
driver)

the 0.0.0.0 is a good practice, yes

Sorry for not answering earlier.

I wanted to point you to that thread but didn't have time to search
it. Good job!

Now, if you have configured CoovaChilli with a 'localusers' file and a
dummy 'radiusserver1', you only have to add to configuration
'uamserver', 'wwwdir' and 'wwwbin' parameters.

The first one (uamserver) must be something like
'http://${ip}:${port}/www/uam.chi'

${ip} and ${port} are from your CoovaChilli configuration (10.0.0.1
and 3990 by default).

'wwwdir' is the folder where static content is saved.

And 'wwwbin' is a CGI binary (or script) which is called when
'uamserver' URL is requested.

You have to write wwwbin so it will display the splash with your "I
accept..." checkbox, processes it and then redirects the user to:

  http://${ip}:${port}/logon?username=${username}&password=${password}

${username} and ${password} must exist in your 'localusers' file.

HTH,

Xabier Oneca_,,_

Subject: [Chilli] uam redirect fail
Message-ID: <129301cffc66$004c2e10$00e48a30$@sanitycomputers.com.au>

Hi all,   Some of our hotspot users are not been redirected to a radius
server from a coova chilli nas. The default coova  redirect page with the
wireless hotspot logo just stops and eventually the browser times out.

 

The most common device to have the issue is a Samsung tablet, and often IOS
devices. It does not seem to happen on most other OS's. 

 

And it does not always happen.  I've seen many coova-chilli redirect threads
but not specifically like this. 

 

Any ideas on what could stop the redirect like this? 

 

Regards 


Jim

Use wireshark (or tcpdump) to get a better picture of what's happening with
that specific client...

Are you redirecting to a HTTPS portal page? if so, make sure your cert
provider's CRL server (where it checks to see if the server cert was
revoked) is in your walled garden.

Thanks David, the problem is I can?t replicate the error? the site is not local to me and hundreds of users have no problem. 

 

It?s not an ssl enabled radius server.

It happens on coovachilli 1.28 & 1.29 on openwrt (using Cloudtrax firmware and the old Robin).

I?ve considered it may be a DNS problem yet the radius server can be accessed by these clients ? just not via the redirect.

 

I will check whether I can setup tcpdump on one of the routers.

Are you able to explain the pre requisites or process for the redirect to happen?

 

Cheers.

No, it isn't. HS_WWWDIR must be a single directory.

i had similar issue when i launched CoovaChilli in hosted environment from
ISP data center. Approximately 35% devices were not getting login page at
all, hence others were able to.The NIC for those devices were unable to
handle MTU of 1504 becomes after VLAN Tag (4Bytes) because NIC do not
support jumbo frame. i did it by setting following directive and never had
the problem again. COOVA is up for over two year since, nearly 5000
concurrent user browse during peak hours.

Of course solution is only applicable if it is VLAN setup.

I configured tcpmss in config file
HS_TCPMSS=1400

i configured mtu in chilli.conf
mtu=1400

You would need to restart instance(s) to take effect. lets see if this
helps.

i do not see the problem, where ever you put files just point *HS_WWWDIR *to
that folder should work. Check your configuration, you have not done
something right. how about permissions on new destination to apache ?


*HS_WWWDIR=/usr/local/etc/chilli/coova-c-media-tech-vlan423/www-cafeclub*
HS_UAMFORMAT=http://\$HS_UAMLISTEN:\$HS_UAMUIPORT/www/login.chi
