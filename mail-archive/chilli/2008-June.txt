Hi Oliver,

Are you by chance using either dhcpstart or dhcpend options? What  
version of chilli are you using? Check "chilli --help" to see if  
dhcpstart/dhcpend have default values (in the current svn, they  
default to '0' for disabled). If you are indeed using dhcpstart/ 
dhcpstop, make sure the range does NOT include the uamlisten IP...  
(so, if that is .1, use dhcpstart=2 and dhcpend=127).

That makes no sense. According to the above 192.168.174.128 is neither 
in the dynip range nor the last one. .129 would be the very first one 
and .254 the last. Could you please give us a real example of "wrong" ip 
address assignment?

I'm operating a large network on v0.9.11 with almost identical setups 
(also a statip .0/25 subnet with dynip .128/25), have experienced no 
issues to date and in fact have just verified with one of the logfiles 
of a busy site that indeed chilli wraps around correctly.

.128 is the network number for the second network (like .0 for first 
network). You're right, that's not a real IP address which can be used.

Yes, .129 is the first IP address of this range. But I was in hurry and 
didn't realized that I have this typo in my mail. Anyway, thanks for 
noticing :)

We'll check this again with a newer version of chilli as David suggested 
already.

Hello,
I couldnt see and entry for coaport on website of the coova-ap
Does it have a default port or do we have to add this lines manually to
configfiles?
And if yes, which conf file ? :)

By default it's OFF. If you want it, specify "coaport <myport>" in 
chilli's config file. Do note that this will also cause chilli to send 
all radius packets from that port.

Any of the ones which are included ;-)

Sorry my mistake, i meant no entry on coovaap configuration page. Sure it
can be editable via ssh. Maybe it might be nice to add this option on
config page too on next release.

Hello, finally i tried coaport on coovaap today.
Frist from my freeradius table i tried to disconnect the user with


echo "User-Name=username" | /usr/bin/radclient coovaapip:1820 disconnect
radsecret

But it waited waited and waited... then i realized i have to modify the
firewall too..
And added 1820 port as i entered in local.conf file too as coaport.

Then when i try again i got the response

Received response ID 33, code 41, length = 34 Vendor-14559-Attr-8 =
0x312e302e3131

It successfully deleted from radius, and even marked as admin disconnect
at radacct table.
But!!!  when i check the webpage of coovaap, the users were still there..
and connected as i figuredout with tcpdump.

So what do i miss?
Or is there another way of disconnecting users that i dont know (except
webpage of coovaap)

Is the user still authenticated (i.e. able to browse the Internet)?  
Or, do they just have a DHCP lease still (which makes them show up in  
the web interface list with auth-state 'dnat' instead of 'pass')?

My mistake,
As i see the username on coova page, i thought the user is still
authenticated.. And the tcpdump traffic was thru one of the "walled
garden" servers.
Ok it works.
But anyway, it might be good to see coaport option on web interface:)

Subject: maxbwup + maxbwdown.
Message-ID: <3ea93a690806090742p6a6a21btc1d3249a0ae9a5d5@mail.gmail.com>

Im testing the bandwidth limits in CoovaChilli in hopes of implementing it,
however, no matter what limit I set it to, bandwidth is always limited to
90-110kbps.

When I set the limit to 0 for both maxbwup + maxbwdown, my speeds shoot up
to around 3000-5000kbps. If I set it to anything else, its always
90-110kbps, no matter what.

Is there a known issue or can anyone help me troubleshoot this one?

Thanks!

We just implemented it here, and in basic testing, it seems to work -
The throughput needs to be averaged over a reasonable period and a
reasonable amount of data before you can see the actual results
though...

We are using Linux (FC9), and a Postgres based Radius install to set
the WISPr-* values.

Hello,
i tried to use coovafx today. First i installed it on xp-firefox 2.0.14
But then when i restart firefox a window opens...and jus written "alert"
on it.
And the coovafx icon seem disabled, and cant be enabled.
Then i tried to install it on a linux, ubuntu with firefox 3..but it
refused to install this plugin because of not finding a secure update??

So in which version of firefox this plugin works?

Make sure your firefox supports Java... I get something similar to  
what you are describing with Firefox on Linux because I don't have it  
setup for Java.

Java is uptodate and enabled on both operating systems.
And this is the java console error report when restarting firefox and

Simply configure different radius server IPs for that.

Hi,

When you explicitly log out using the 1.1.1.1 address, you get the
login screen back.  When you then login again, chilli redirects you
to 1.1.1.1 and this immediately logs you out again!

I think that chilli should never redirect to 1.1.1.1, as this
behavior may cause a lot of confusion for "normal" hotspot users.

I've finished the 1st revision of the freebsd port, I still need to write documentation, redo the up/down shell scripts & write some template configs.
I'd appreciate it if people could do some testing both on 6.x & 7.x releases.

http://www.geeklan.co.uk/files/coova-freebsd-port-mk1.tgz

If you need a main.conf to mod out here's one I pinched from a linux install:
http://geeklan.co.uk/files/coova-main.conf

I think there is more work involved code wise as chilli keeps on coredumping on a test box, though I'm not certain if its the machine I'm trying it thats having problems.

Hi,

I noticed that especially the web-browser of Nokia products keeps  
complaining about switching from a secured to a non-secured website.  
This browser behaviour complicates the login for a user since he has  
to click through the warning message everytime he logs on.

How do you deal with this? Using a non-https connection to the UAM  
server is not a real alternative, is it? Are there any known measures  
to avoid those warning messages?

Thought about how to deal with this problem many times myself. Only 
solution I can think of at this stage is to get a professionally signed 
SSL certificate for your uamip (e.g. 192.168.182.1) and run an ssl 
tunnel in front of your chilli process (e.g. matrixtunnel). This 
requires firmware changes though (if you use coova ap or any other 
embedded platform).

Personally, I use CoovaSX on my nokia instead of the browser to login. I
don't think using http is the right answer for many hotspots - perhaps
for some where account security isn't so important. 

You probably wouldn't get the error if you used the JSON interface or if
you always redirected the user to a 'start' page. If the user is
clicking on a http link from a https page (as opposed to being
redirected to http from a https URL), maybe you will not have the issue.

Hello,
I was using coovaap 1.0-beta-7d for a while with WRT54GL..
And i wanted to upgrade the files.
I SSH'ed...and gave the command ipkg update and ipkg upgrade..
While it was downloading and updating the files..
It started giving no space left on device error.
And it wasnt accepting any other comands later.
I tried my only chance and rebooted..
And i reset the system.
Now when i connect to web interface it asks me to enter a new password but
when it is writing it it gives the error. It seems the flash is still
full.
To tdelete some files i try to ssh to system but.
It doesnt accept blank/admin/root etc passwords as i know for default.
What can i do now.. how can i make it work again? :)

LOL for fun i just tested that and same result, file system full errors
everywhere and completely unresponsive later, even a reset to factory
default pushing of the button did not resolv the issue, it did reset the
ssid to Coova but refused to give a wireless IP via dhcp. so we go to
the lan side, and nothing there either, so id consider it pretty
briicked try TFTPing a new image and start over i guess

Ok next time i better write " To not try this at home" warning in my
emails :)

So..what if i want to update to latest version of coova-chilli for example
with coovaap firmware.
removing and reinstalling it will redownload the updated image from the
souce-list of coova?

Ok i saved my bricked modem.
First i tried to enter to failsafe mode..By pressing reset button just
after the DMZ light goes on.
But even in this screen it didnt allow me to write password.
So i downloaded the coova firmware with wget and used mtk command to
rewrite flash..
But it failed and turned into a total brick. Just with a blinking power led.
But i noticed it replies to ping requests on 192.168.1.1
So i tried to upload image by tftp and voila..it works now.
:)

Subject: How to change map.chi to avoid CSS conflicts?
Message-ID: <200806231213.m5NCDkqq005413@jasmine.xos.nl>

Hi,

Did someone find out how to change map.chi in such a way, that the
Google map does not interfere with custom CSS settings (like
background color etc.)?

I hope it is be possible to have a correct Google map (equal to
what you get when you don't have custom CSS settings) in an own 
style page, e.g. with an own background color.  If I do that now,
all kinds of items (like the text balloon, +/- sliders, etc.)
look wrong.

Any suggestions?

Message-ID: <51615.139.179.14.250.1214396598.squirrel@webmail.bilkent.edu.tr>



Hello,
as i see there's a new update for coovafx. Previously i was getting a java
error but in this new version it seem fixed.
Ok.. here we go..
I am not sure if it is only working with coovaap or not but,
I am testing it with a coova version running on linux...
Anyway,
i installed the plugin to a client and tried to test it..
Plugin loaded successfully..And my hotstop name seen on the right
bottomside of the firefox as expected..
But.... not logging in...In debug mode i can see the uamlogin information
correctly, i mean the url... but when i clik on auto-login or manual
login.. no error no connection..nothing..
Do i have to make additional configs in coova to accept coovafx plugin?
Or does it suppose to work automatically?


PS: I am not using the default login screen of coova or chilli. We have
our own login screen for that.

Your using your own captive portal? If so, I would suggest looking in
the logs for the authentication requests. Your portal also needs to
"support WISPr" in some respects. If you have a special URL you want to
send WISPr clients to, you can set that as option 'wisprlogin' in
coovachilli.

Hey,

If you haven't already, checkout CoovaFX 1.2 - now working on windows
and linux (at least ubuntu hardy). Test your hotspot for WISPr support!

http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaFX

Also, have committed some changes to the Drupal hotspot module to
include browser redirect logins, in addition to the Javascript
controller. With browser redirects, you can setup your UAM secret in the
drupal admin.

Hello all,

I'm using CoovaChilli in 3 Hotspots, with 200 user's simultaneous, it's
cool! But I'm having problems with bandwidth manager.

See my problem

HTTP: Downloads and Uploads is limited perfect
WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Down and WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Up


P2P: Downloads and Uploads isn't limited :(

This is killing my network...

I'm using iptables + layer-7 + ipp2p but any programs continue using
VERY bandwidth.

Somebody have the same problem ? Any idea about solve this ?

thank you

Carlos

The bandwidth shaping in chilli doesn't care about the protocol, so your
findings are interesting. What do your iptables rules look like?

We have a similar problem but i dont think it is smthing about the chilli
or iptables.
SOmetimes ..some ip's appear on arp table of the ethernet interface of the
chilli..
These IP's are bypassing speed limitations of the chilli.We couldnt find
what causes this problems but even rarely..it happens..
Maybe the Tun driver can not handle the requests sometimes..
