<PRE>Hi Everyone.

I've been using the HS_ADMUSR and HS_ADMPWD options for some time now
to add extra options to the chilli config based on a user in the
radius database. However it seems the time has come to look at the
radconf option in more detail.

Basically I need the ability to change more options than ADMUSR is
letting me. Using adminuser and adminpasswd is great for adding things
like uamallow as it just adds to the uamallow already defined in
main.conf. (adminuser is putting the values returned by radius in
/etc/chilli/local.conf which is included last by /etc/chilli.conf ).

However, trying to change things like uamlisten don't work as then
chilli complains about duplicate config options. I easily worked
around this when I was trying to set the macpasswd from radius, but
disabling the macpassword in /etc/chilli/config, however
/etc/chilli/functions has defaults for things like uamlisten, so that
trick doesn't work.

&gt;<i>From my play with HS_RADCONF, it appears that with HS_RADCONF=on, the
</I>difference for chilli_radconfig (probably the difference is more in
/etc/chilli/functions) is that it gets the options from radius and now
stores them in /etc/chilli/hs.conf instead of /etc/chilli/local.conf.
However, this still doesn't work as /etc/chilli/functions still writes
the main.conf and now we again have values in main.conf that are in
hs.conf.

So it would appear that my only option is to edit /etc/chilli.conf to
exclude main.conf, and then duplicate everything that is normally in
main.conf, in radius so that hs.conf contains everything. This would
also mean that NOTHING can be set in /etc/chilli/config except radius
settings.

Is there no other easy way to &quot;override&quot; values via radius?

I think my only solution is to store the values in another db, and in
/etc/chilli/config dynamically set the values with scripts. I
understand that it can be hard to get everything from radius, as
things like HS_LANIF are used very early on in /etc/chilli/functions
and so changing that part way through would be difficult, as would
trying to get it from radius at the start so that it can be set from
as early as possible.

Any other thoughts on the best way to do this? And can someone who
understands HS_RADCONF better write some documentation for it?

Thanks

Tim
