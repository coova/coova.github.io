Hi.
I'm using chilli talking to radius thru a vpn.
I just noticed when the VPN is terminated, if some users are still connected their session will remain open on the freeradius server, remaining there forever.

Is there any option to terminate those stale sessions?

thanks

You can add logic to your radius server that will close out sessions
that haven't seen accounting in some time...

Hi Jed,

Did you get Content-Injection working with Coova Chilli?

A long time ago I tried this with various proxies (Tinyproxy, Privoxy, Squid with content adaption) but I do remember reading David Bird's blog post about content injection natively in Coova Chilli which sounds much neater if its now part of Coova Chilli (I didn't think it was yet?)

thanks,

Derek

Subject: [Chilli] Captive portal "looping" problem - maybe radius /
	radius-proxy timeout problem ?
Message-ID: <B85120C0-55ED-4E4F-824D-3CB07CE274DD@hssl.ie>

Hi everyone,

I've been playing with coova chilli for years and its feature set is great and I really love new features (especially chilli_proxy that appeared in 1.2.9)!.

I'm having a problem and I think I've also seen this problem over the years too.

I'm using coova chilli 1.2.9 and right now I'm using chilli-proxy with HTTP authentication (so no radius server at all) and I'm using mac authentication.

The problem is that for some reason coova chilli thinks the user isn't authorised so it sends the user to the login page (uamhomepage) *but* I have checking in my home page to see if the user is actually authenticated (in the DB) or not and, if they are, I try to redirect them to www.google.com - I'd hope this situation wouldn't happen but it does regularly.  Its worse actually because I can sometimes see devices looping through my uamhomepage page over and over again and then, maybe, eventually getting Google.  (coova chilli keeps thinking the client isn't authenticated - when this happens I can see that my web server handling the chilli proxy requests as per the uamaaaurl directive is *NOT* getting the coova chilli request at all!).

I see this problem more if the internet connection to the coova chilli enabled AP is slow.  This makes me think its some kind of radius timeout issue.  I did add the line "radiustimeout=90" to my chilli conf file (I think that sets the radius timeout to 90 seconds) but this didn't appear to have any effect.

I haven't seen anything in the chilli log output yet but mostly this is because I haven't been getting detailed logs in my APs.  Now I'm trying to use remote syslog to a dedicated server so this might help.

The issue could be in chilli_proxy.  If so I might have to go back to having a freeradius server but I'd hate to do that.

Has anyone else seen this type of problem before?

thanks for any info!

Derek

Ok - an update.

Adding in syslog-ng and remote logging *was* a good idea for sure!

This is the error that seems to be related to my problem: -

Jul 14 15:16:17 5.54.29.155 syslog: main-proxy.c: 142: out of connections

I wonder is there somehow a connect leak?

This AP would not be that busy.  I see that in the source code there is a max number of requests set to 16 and I would think that this should be perfectly good so I wonder is there some kind of connection leak?

Hi,

I think that there is a requests leak in main-proxy.c.  I increased the max_requests from 16 to 256 and then left a bunch of APs running for a good few days.  Looking today and I can see that some APs have under 200 requests free and another AP has no requests free and its spitting out the "out of connections" debug message.  I added in some more debug messages to constantly print how many requests are available.

It means that the  num_requests_free is sometimes not getting incremented so sometimes close_request() mustn't be getting called for some reason?

Sample output with my extra debugging below (outputting when num_requests_free-- and num_requests_free++) .  You'll see that the free requests is hanging around 214.  When chilli_proxy is started the free requests are 256 but here they've leaked down to 214.

Hi List,

What does this directive means when using with layer 2 setup? Disable
builtin CoovaChilli DHCP?

HS_NODYNIP=on

i need to disabling internal DHCP server and use "isc-dhcp-server"

Hi everyone,

I want to double-check something:

With macauth set & macreauth set does this mean that its fine to re-direct a user to a non-UAMALLOWED server/URL *after* their MAC has been added to the radius server?  I.E. Will Coova Chilli *always* do a new radius check if 1) CoovaChilli thinks (via last radius check) that the user is not authed and the user is directed to a non-UAMALLOWED URL ?

Is it important, or even necessary, to redirect the user to a Coova Chilli internal web server URL to force a radius re-check ?   (and if this *is* actually necessary what is the exact URL when using macauth anyway?)

thanks for any info!

Macreauth can be used that way, but will also generate a huge number of
RADIUS requests, which can quickly become a problem. You can instead
redirect to chilli url uamlisten:uamport/macreauth do specifically have
it re-do macauth.

Cheers,
David

Better would be to use DHCP relay options, 

      --dhcpgateway=STRING      DHCP gateway addresss for relay
      --dhcpgatewayport=INT     DHCP gateway port for relay
(default=`67')
      --dhcprelayagent=STRING   DHCP relay agent IP addresss (default 

So that chilli can learn the IPs as they are assigned...

Hi, at one time tried dhtsprelay, if you specify dhcppgatewayport, chilli
uses that port for communicate with dhcp server and same port for
subscribers and they don't receive configuration.

It may vary with your set-up.Below the steps which we enabled CoovaChilli
with Squid.

Add Post-auth proxy settings in chilli config file

#   Post-Auth proxy settings
HS_POSTAUTH_PROXY=192.168.1.150
HS_POSTAUTH_PROXYPORT=3128

Add the below parameter in squid.conf file -

# Squid normally listens to port 3128
#http_port 3128

http_port 192.168.1.150:3128 transparent

And define the proper IP table entry.Below my IP table entry for chilli and
squid

#basic
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sysctl -p
#Squid
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to
192.168.1.150:3128
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT
--to-port 3128

I am new user working on coova-chilli.
I would like to compile the Coova-chilli source code with uclibc toolchain.
But, i am facing errors while doing "make".

Message-ID: <CAGdcU6oF0_-fOjvqGr0Ev_AVU+N705bHHvVeWYqfp6=H_NzOew@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I set up a coovachilli + freeradius + mysql combo at my dorm. It's
working great with the wired network. Now we want to extend it to the
wireless as well. Installed an access point configured to wpa2
enterprise (with the same radius server) and connected to the
coovachillis's lan side. It can authenticate users and do the process
fine, but when i want to connect to the internet, i get redirected to
the coovachilli's captive portal.
I've read about the wpa guest config parameter, but i don't want to
let users without sufficient credentials to connect, and reach any of
my device (neither the captive portal nor the webpages which I allowed
with uam_allow).

So is there a way, that the users, who authenticated successfully
through wpa2 (peap + mschapv2) do not need to reauthenticate at the
captive portal page (and not let users who failed at wpa2 to try to
authenticate themselves on the captive portal).

Thanks for all the reply, all the best

Subject: [Chilli] Chilli_Query login issue
Message-ID: <00cf01ce88aa$38f08df0$aad1a9d0$@cabocom.cv>

Hi everyone,

 

I've got a very strange problem.

 

Setup:

 

Chilli 1.2.9 Running with Layer3

 

Client with static IP provided by isc-dhcp running on VLAN ID 40

 

 

If I make the login normally (open browser, type user and password) the
internet works great.

 

If I do the login on the chillibox with:
/usr/local/sbin/chilli_query -s /usr/local/var/run/chilli.vlan40.sock login
ip 10.1.1.xx username <username> password <password>

 

The login is performed good (show the session on radius) and internet start
working, but the speed is terribly slow.

 

If I logout and do the login via web browser on client, the speed is good
again.

 

To help, if I do the login via chilli_query, I get this on chilli_query
list:

10.1.40.19 51f031c700000004 1 <USERNAME> 57/0 11/1800 33542/0 11791/0
1392508928 0 0%/1024000 0%/3072000

 

If I do it via web browser:

 

10.1.40.19 51f032b400000004 1 <USERNAME> 11/0 0/1800 129190/0 40875/0
1392508928 0 0%/1024000 0%/3072000 http://www.google.com/

 

As you can see, the download speed is the same (3Mb) and Upload speed also
(1Mb)

 

Is there any way that chilli_query if failing on the login process?

Hi,

First, you can send the RADIUS from the WPA2 Enterprise AP/Authenticator
to chilli after configuring the following:

      --proxylisten=STRING      Proxy IP address to listen on
      --proxyport=INT           Proxy UDP port to listen on (0 is off)  
      --proxyclient=STRING      IP address of proxy client(s)
      --proxysecret=STRING      Radius proxy shared secret

These settings control what IP and port chilli will listen for RADIUS on
and who can send to it. Chilli will then proxy this RADIUS through to
it's configured RADIUS servers. When clients are authenticated for
802.1x, that is then known to chilli and they are authenticated in
chilli. The "WPA Guests" feature allows you do program your RADIUS
server such that it will return Access-Accept even for client stations
that did not successfully authenticate. The Access-Accept is needed for
them to pass the 802.1x/EAP phase and to be able to interact with chilli
and the captive portal. Adding the RADIUS attribute:

ChilliSpotConfig=require-uam-auth

to the Access-Accept which didn't really succeed will prompt chilli to
treat the client as unauthorized and sent to the captive portal.

Hi!

I've experienced similar problem when I've been changing user's speed on 
the fly. I think I've solved the problem by also insering mac directive 
and using authorize insted of update or smth like that. I don't remember 
very well.

Best regards, Bojan

Hi David,

Yes, this is not the first time that this happen to me. But for the other times, I would just change the IP on ISC-DHCP to a new one, and Chilli would start working properly on that different IP.
Also, other thing that would help would be to kill Chilli process and restart it. That Way it would work correctly the command. But now it does not work in any way.
Is there another way of doing a remote login of an account?

There shouldn't be a difference. You get this result consistently? 


====================================================================================

Hi, the problem is that I'm making this setup for a client, so this has to trigger the account for traffic and BW management.

Hi list,

This might help someone in configuring chilli's dchp setting. 

I had a problem in setting up dhcp to give a range of /16 ip addresses. 

Please read below if you are also facing the same problems.

Hi David!

Thanks for the solution, it works, i should've thought about it by myself.

If i understand correctly i can not use different radius secret on
each and every access points. If is the situation, is there any way to
get to know, which session is through which access point (the initial
access point is enough, if there is roaming between the aps).

Thanks again

D?vid

Subject: [Chilli] Captive portal "looping" problem - maybe radius /
 radius-proxy timeout problem ?

Hi Derek. You should check the date format that you're using. I have the
same problem but it is because the date that radius use is like this:
YYYY:MM:DD-hh:mm:ss:ss. In numbers, the date is set like
2013:05:03-00:00:00. So radius gets caught in a loop because the date is
still valid but the hours are not.  Unfortunately , in my case I have to
use that format but maybe you can change the one that you use.
Could you tell me how are you using the chilli_proxy feature? Is it to
intercept the borwser request to a proxy server

Subject: [Chilli] separate landing page for each customer coovachilli
Message-ID: <CADao4Cq1AgMa5U_BvAxCvHQYErG2h7BYuE930ZR4aNzo_pNG9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi CoovaChilli List,

i have coovachilli_1.3.0 running as central server in multi
tenancy environment (ISP Data Center). CoocaChilli is serving about 50
hotspots across the city using VLANs. All instances work normal, no issue.
But i have asked to provide separate landing page for each customer with
their company logo.

i have:

*nano /usr/local/etc/chilli/coova-vlan10/config*
*
*
HS_WWWDIR=/usr/local/etc/chilli/uploads/www-cafeclub
HS_WWWBIN=/usr/local/etc/chilli/upload/wwwsh

HS_UAMHOMEPAGE=http://

Firefox & IE reports: Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting
the request for this address in a way that will never complete.

Thanks / Regards

Hi everyone,

New updates on the issue

I was looking it to it, and I realize that the ping was working fine.
I then start increase the packet size, and found out that it happen when I try to send more than 1485 bytes (MTU limit?!?!)

Since I got and WRT54GL router in client mode as the test subject, I thought that it could be the firmware on it causing this. So I replace this with a laptop, and the problem kept going, so it is not a router problem.

I'm inclined to believe that this problem could be something related to chilli_query not fully performing a login on a client and chilli is not making the split of the information on several packets.

The fun thing is that other instances of chilli have a couple of them working, and somehow, changing IP's and rebooting the instances, they start working, except this.
By the way, I've already confirmed all the setting, and tacking the vlan setting all are the same, as they always were.


=============================================
Hi David,

Yes, this is not the first time that this happen to me. But for the other times, I would just change the IP on ISC-DHCP to a new one, and Chilli would start working properly on that different IP.
Also, other thing that would help would be to kill Chilli process and restart it. That Way it would work correctly the command. But now it does not work in any way.
Is there another way of doing a remote login of an account?

From: David Bird [mailto:david at coova.com] 

There shouldn't be a difference. You get this result consistently? 


====================================================================================

Hi, the problem is that I'm making this setup for a client, so this has to trigger the account for traffic and BW management.


From: Bojan

I've experienced similar problem when I've been changing user's speed on the fly. I think I've solved the problem by also insering mac directive and using authorize insted of update or smth like that. I don't remember very well.

Best regards, Bojan

There are several ways...

Enable the compile time option --enable-location and also
--enable-proxyvsa

Then I think what you want is to use runtime option --locationcopycalled

Or, --proxylocattr=# where you can define the RADIUS attribute code (#)
of the attribute from hostapd that you want to use as "location" to be
sent in attribute ChilliSpot-Location.

Hello,

I just use:

 pidof chilli && killall -TERM chilli

And then start chilli as usual.

But you can use:

  pidof chilli || start_chilli_as_usual

You can associate NAS-ID with accounts in a DB and check in the UAM to

Subject: [Chilli] Multiple Login Pages With CoovaChilli_1.3.0 [SOLVED
	!!!!!!]
Message-ID: <CADao4CqZi3TeGzv4CB16gV45rji4OoLM+H9BpDyagkkwuaetZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi CoovaChilli List,

i have coovachilli_1.3.0 running as central server in multi
tenancy environment (ISP Data Center) using VLANs. CoocaChilli is serving
about 50 hotspots across the city. A separate CoovaChilli instance is
running on each VLAN. All instances work normal, without any issue. But i
have asked to provide separate landing page for each customer with their
company logo on the login page.

i have the following setup:

root at captive:/usr/local/etc/chilli# ls -l uploads/

drwxr-xr-x  7 www-data www-data 4096 Jul 29 16:04 ./
drwxr-xr-x 10 root     root     4096 Jul 25 15:06 ../
drwxrwxr-x  5 chilli   www-data 4096 Jul 29 15:24 www-cafeclub/
drwxrwxr-x  4 chilli   www-data 4096 Jul 29 16:17 www-yzone/

*nano /usr/local/etc/chilli/coova-vlan10/config*

Firefox Reports: Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the
request for this address in a way that will never complete.

*SOLUTION: *
i wish to reply my own post because i am able to solve the problem. Here is
the solution for following requirement.

# Phrase Included For Google Search From Archives

It might possibly help if you can provide details of the error that 
you're getting when you try to build.

Hi Chuck, how u doin?

actually, isn't a mistake. sorry for my last message, the problems is
that after following steps by [1] using "dhbuild -b". the package *.deb
missing some files! look the size.

[root at wifi coova-chilli.svn]# dhbuild -b
...............
[root at wifi coova-chilli.svn]# ls -lh ../
total 52K
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4.0K Jul 31 18:14 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4.0K Jul 30 20:17 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  34K Jul 31 18:14 coova-chilli_1.3.0_amd64.deb
[root at wifi coova-chilli.svn]#

after trying using debin/rules directly, have same problem.

[root at wifi coova-chilli.svn]#fakeroot ./debian/rules clean binary
[root at wifi coova-chilli.svn]#
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4.0K Jul 31 18:14 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4.0K Jul 30 20:17 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  34K Jul 31 18:14 coova-chilli_1.3.0_amd64.deb
[root at wifi coova-chilli.svn]#

if anyone have some idea, tell us! :)

Subject: [Chilli] Problems with SVN/HEAD + deb package (SOLVED)
Message-ID: <CABvP5W3i6HyDbd3q7g7GsO-PVJ3GD+WRUpTvDQ_Y8s3mKNo5nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Chuck,

  after investigation, i've compared the root directory from
daloradius-0.9-9.tar.gz/debian/*.* with latest
revision found in svn/debian/*.* and found this file debian/compat[1],
my simple change was to update
the compatibility level of debhelper like [1]

my workstation is:

[root at wifi svn]# lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 7.1 (wheezy)
Release:        7.1
Codename:       wheezy
[root at wifi svn]#

and my debhelper

[root at wifi svn]# dpkg -s debhelper | grep ^Version
Version: 9.20120909
[root at wifi svn]#

[1] http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/dother.en.html#compat
