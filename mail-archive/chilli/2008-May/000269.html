</I>As far as I can tell from the code the mac authentication (be it through 
radius or locally) only happens during establishment of the dhcp 
connection. Once the connection has been initiated no re-authentication 
occurs so what you observe seems consistent.

To answer your question, I do think that's a bug, I just don't know how 
that could be solved as mac-authenticated clients don't explicitly 
trigger any sorts of events, i.e. no user interaction happens for 
authentication, other than the initial dhcp request. Triggering a radius 
auth for every packet that gets routed to the Internet perhaps? But that 
might be way too inefficient...
