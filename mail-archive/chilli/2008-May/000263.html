<PRE>Hi Gunther,

The issue is that chilli's _raw_ socket on the dhcpif sees packets  
_before_ the kernel does. This is why you should be dropping all  
input on the dhcpif interface in iptables - because otherwise you  
have chilli _and_ the kernel processing (and potentially forwarding  
the same) packets. So, you can not use iptables to filter traffic  
coming into chilli. As you noted, you _can_ control how packets are  
forwarded through the kernel -- this includes packets chilli is  
forwarding through the tun interface.

As for accounting, it really should be counting (per RFC) data  
received from and sent to the subscriber from the NAS. Meaning, it is  
doing the right thing by counting all packets received and sent to  
the subscriber, even if later dropped by iptables.

I suppose a feature you would like -- and others have mentioned it  
too -- would be something like an &quot;acctignore&quot; option to list out (in  
a uamallowed fashion) networks to not count in accounting. This way  
you can exclude the same ports you are filtering...

</I>&gt;<i> What can I do, if anything, to make sure that either chilli
