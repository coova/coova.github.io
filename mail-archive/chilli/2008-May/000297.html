<PRE>Hi,

	More Chilli questions, but original, not Coova. I again look to a 
solid install base. (And anyone that might help the author of DD-WRT to get
Coova running under it)

	It appears, probably due to the network, that radius accounting
records aren't always making it back to the radius server. Since I can't
get the person to fix the network, I need to try to find a way to
compensate for it.

	In radius they want to set Simultaneous-User to 1. However, 
checking radwho -C:

lobnic14   00-13-02-25-8C-   shell S1   Thu 17:3  192.168.7 192.168.182.3
lobnic14   00-1B-77-11-F4-   shell S2   Thu 18:2  192.168.7 192.168.182.4
lobnic14   00-1B-77-11-F4-   shell S3   Wed 18:1  192.168.7 192.168.182.14

	(Yea, one user appears to be on twice, and then there is a 2nd login).

	If he was to set it to 1 right now, there would be support calls, and
he HATES to support people....

	SO, what I was wondering, is if in some sense Chilli is &quot;self aware&quot;.
Can I ask it, poke it, prod it, etc to see who is actively connected at the
time? I'd use the checkrad radius program to update the files once and a bit.

	Thanks, Tuc
