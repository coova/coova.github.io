<PRE>If you are more able to patch chillispot in dd-wrt, then just  
consider coova-chilli a really big chillispot patch (which it is). I  
personally haven't compiled it on xscale, but I don't know what you  
mean by it not being arm/xscale ready. I assume you mean that there  
is a byte order issue somewhere -- which there was, actually, in the  
original chillispot, fixed by OpenWrt for the FONera. This patch is  
not in CoovaChilli only because I did the same fix differently. If  
there are other endian issues that I am unaware of, well, it would be  
nice if someone made them known instead of spreading mis-information.

Perhaps you will find better hotspot centric community support here  
-- using CoovaChilli/AP :)
