<PRE>Hi,

	I'm not &quot;able&quot; per se. I'll put it in as a ticket and see if the
powers to be accept it. I've actually turned my attention to something
else I'd RATHER have instead though... The &quot;Accounting-On/Off&quot; patches.
I think thats a better solution to the problem they are running into.

	As for the ENDIAN/ARM/XSCALE issue.... Thats beyond my knowledge,
I'm just cutting/pasting the reason I was given by the DD-WRT author. If
its untrue, I have no problem going back and saying &quot;Its fixed, take another
look, and PLEASE get it in there for the next release&quot;. Unfortuantely,
thats also where my capabilities end. I'm not a committer, so I don't have
the authority to do it, just beg/plead. If someone wants to help campaign
it to the author, I'll be happy to offlist give an email contact address.

	For the umpteenth time, I'm not on old school Chilli because I 
want to. My hands are tied. Short of buying the WISP thats doing this, I
don't own it yet so don't have any authority to do anything except give
my opinion and suggestions. I would like almost nothing more (I'd like
only 1 thing more than this, but I can't mention it on list) than to be
using Coova on DD-WRT!!!!!!!!

</I>&gt;<i> If you are more able to patch chillispot in dd-wrt, then just  
</I>&gt;<i> consider coova-chilli a really big chillispot patch (which it is). I  
</I>&gt;<i> personally haven't compiled it on xscale, but I don't know what you  
</I>&gt;<i> mean by it not being arm/xscale ready. I assume you mean that there  
</I>&gt;<i> is a byte order issue somewhere -- which there was, actually, in the  
</I>&gt;<i> original chillispot, fixed by OpenWrt for the FONera. This patch is  
</I>&gt;<i> not in CoovaChilli only because I did the same fix differently. If  
</I>&gt;<i> there are other endian issues that I am unaware of, well, it would be  
</I>&gt;<i> nice if someone made them known instead of spreading mis-information.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you will find better hotspot centric community support here  
</I>&gt;<i> -- using CoovaChilli/AP :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; its just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; way too much and have to find other means of accomplishing my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; goals. But now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I have direction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't think taking patches back to chillispot is that great of an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; idea. CoovaChilli has _many_ fixes and new features that make it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; worth the switch. I wonder that the point is in keeping chillispot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; limping along with band-aids.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	I agree its not a great idea. Its worse than chicken wire and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bubble gum in my opinion. But bringing Coova over to DD-WRT isn't  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happening
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because as the author has stated &quot;right now coova is not big endian  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arm/xscale safe&quot;. I'm limited in what I can do with presenting  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the person running the network. If it can't be supported by the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DD-WRT
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community through a general distribution release, then its  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unacceptable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That means, instead of allowing me to add a small script that would  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backup
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the config of the appliance, as well as restore it during a &quot;I've  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been reset
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to default&quot; reboot, he rolls a truck when a unit loses all the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there someone who rolled a version with this in it? Yes. Is it  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the DD-WRT images? No. So, it doesn't happen. I have my hands tied.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same people rather suffer a 6 hour outage due to equipment  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; failure, than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get emails saying the equipment is down the seconds it happens  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since &quot;Too many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emails makes Vista work poorly&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	So until the big endian and arm/xscale issue is resolved in BS's  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; view,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Coova makes it into DD-WRT, I'm stuck with what can be done in  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the mean time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And that, unfortunately, may mean some ugly patching potentially.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or, just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; letting yet another thing be &quot;ignored&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
