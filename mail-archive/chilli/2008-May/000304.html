<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	Kewl, exactly what I need. Maybe I can see what it took to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this can get it patched into the old server for use. Or, I'll find  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way too much and have to find other means of accomplishing my  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goals. But now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think taking patches back to chillispot is that great of an  
</I>&gt;<i> idea. CoovaChilli has _many_ fixes and new features that make it  
</I>&gt;<i> worth the switch. I wonder that the point is in keeping chillispot  
</I>&gt;<i> limping along with band-aids.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>	I agree its not a great idea. Its worse than chicken wire and
bubble gum in my opinion. But bringing Coova over to DD-WRT isn't happening
because as the author has stated &quot;right now coova is not big endian and 
arm/xscale safe&quot;. I'm limited in what I can do with presenting something
to the person running the network. If it can't be supported by the DD-WRT
community through a general distribution release, then its unacceptable.
That means, instead of allowing me to add a small script that would backup
the config of the appliance, as well as restore it during a &quot;I've been reset
to default&quot; reboot, he rolls a truck when a unit loses all the configuration.
Is there someone who rolled a version with this in it? Yes. Is it default in
the DD-WRT images? No. So, it doesn't happen. I have my hands tied. This is
the same people rather suffer a 6 hour outage due to equipment failure, than
get emails saying the equipment is down the seconds it happens since &quot;Too many 
emails makes Vista work poorly&quot;. 

	So until the big endian and arm/xscale issue is resolved in BS's view,
and Coova makes it into DD-WRT, I'm stuck with what can be done in the mean time.
And that, unfortunately, may mean some ugly patching potentially. Or, just
letting yet another thing be &quot;ignored&quot;.
