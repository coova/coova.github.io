</I>No, and this is the one and only case where uamanyip fails. You see, if 
you ignore all IP's outside the dynamic dhcp range you might as well not 
use uamanyip as it then wouldn't serve any purpose whatsoever.

But I doubt this is any cause for concern and is a highly unlikely case 
anyways. Somebody who arrives at a hotspot with a static ip and no 
gateway likely has never used the Internet before and doesn't use the 
Internet where he comes from because without a default gateway it's 
impossible for ANY client ANYWHERE to connect to the Internet. So 
chances are you're dealing with somebody who doesn't know how to use the 
Internet and probably wouldn't want to use it in the first place. You 
see, I doubt you'll ever encounter such a case.

Gunther
