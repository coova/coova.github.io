<PRE>I am working at integrating coovachilli with dansguardian.  Sending the 
list command to the socket returns the data for all active sessions.  As 
I want to keep the socket communication to a minimum, I've modified 
coovachilli (see attached patch) to return only the ip or mac requested.
Would you consider merging these changes* for two reasons:
1. Other's can benifit.
2. I don't have to modify the source each time I upgrade coova on my system.


NOTES:
1.  There are two lines that didn't want to compile due to a required 
third argument when open() uses O_CREAT, (chilli.patch:9 &amp; 
chilli.patch:18).  This is not the main reason for this patch, but I've 
included these fixes anyway.
2.  I'm not fussed if anyone has a better idea for command names instead 
of 'listip' and 'listmac'.  Same goes for CMDSOCK_ENTRY_FOR_MAC and 
CMDSOCK_ENTRY_FOR_IP.


* I understand that you will want to review the code.  In fact, that 
would be appreciated - if you don't mind.
