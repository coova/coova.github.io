<PRE>I've seen this with OpenWRT, some times, at boot, the ntpclient does not update? Strange and random behaviour, but still happens. Could be that the eth interface is slower than the init.d/ntpclient process.



NTP Client out of sync? not running at boot? or just servers down?

you mean on the Chilli host? Could be, it's a wrt, maybe when it was started there was no WAN and time failed to sync...
