Subject: [Chilli] CoovaAP from source
Message-ID: <AANLkTinBgwhYbBFYdoKDZgefoeS4b5gRUggyaZH9GjQc@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Could someone direct me to some documentation on how to create the CoovaAP
firmware from source? I've not had any luck trying to follow what sparse
instructions there are.

So far I have downloaded the whiterussian branch of openwrt. I've applied
patch svn-rev-9287.patch and built it to get an image. However, I'm
obviously missing some steps because there is no coova-chilli in the image.

I am trying to do this so I can compile coova-chilli 1.2.2 with the
--enable-radsec option, so if anyone has an image with that, it would be
just as useful.

Regards,
Tim

Hi Tim,

Information on the packages added to OpenWrt can be found here:
http://coova.org/CoovaAP/OpenWrtPackages

You will probably want to upgrade to CoovaChilli 1.2.3 (current
subversion head), which I will be releasing formally very soon. For a
recent snapshot, see:

http://coova-chilli.s3.amazonaws.com/coova-chilli-1.2.3-rc1.tar.gz

Sorry for the delay with 1.2.3; we have been working with some customers
on some new(er) features and have been trying to find more time to
ensure proper init scripts and default configurations for more platform
(at least for OpenWrt, SUSE, RedHat, Debian/Ubuntu). Any volunteers
willing to help with packaging support/testing are welcome!!

Cheers,
David

With several inquiring about 1.2.3, it's time for a release. Binaries
will come a bit later on.

Hello there,

I'm back with a brand new version of my web interface bundle, which is more
clever and fixes some major bugs compared to the initial release.

Let's see what's new in this version:

- Timeouts are set to be more user-friendly, which means the user always has
the time to read error messages and never has to wait too much if something
goes wrong. Default timeouts: refresh status page every 5 secs, timeout JSON
requests after 25 seconds, show error messages for 10 seconds before
refreshing status.
- Failed login attempts generate an error message - it's more logical, than
just redirecting to the login screen without telling the user what happened
- Redirections work correctly now - in some cases, the OS or the browser
sends a request to some remote site, before a user-specified site opens in
the browser, therefore a random site may be loaded after the user logs in. I
fixed this by reading the "userurl" variable from the request which always
seems to contain the URL entered by the user (or the browser's home page).
- When the user disconnects, the wait page appears for half a second to give
time to the logoff command to finish executing.
- The bundle has been tested with 4 major browsers (IE6-8, FF2-3, Opera 10,
Chrome). IE and FF run the code perfectly, while Opera and Chrome may have
some issues, probably because of their "improved" JavaScript engines. Opera
seems to silently ignore the URL passed to window.open (it just opens a
blank browser window). Chrome does the same, except that it loads the URL
(it's shown in the address bar), but refuses to run any JS code, just a
plain white page is shown to the user. These issues need to be fixed to make
the interface more compatible with different browsers.

Probably you could include this in the source bundle to be used as a
template, I made really easy to customize it. Just modify the placeholders
in "index.html" and "splash.html" and the interface is ready to be used.


Best regards
Gergely Kiss

Hi,

this seems to be a problem with your chilli configuration. Make sure that
your Chilli configuration has the HS_UAMSECRET and HS_UAMSERVICE variables
unset:

HS_UAMSECRET=
HA_UAMSERVICE=

Restart chilli and test if it works.

Dear Cornelius,

I'm afraid you won't be able to install CoovaChilli on your WRT120N device,
as it doesn't seem to be supported by any of the popular third party
firmwares. I've googled it: OpenWRT and DD-WRT doesn't support this device,
it's very unlikely that other, less popular firmwares could be used on it.
:(

If you want to use Chilli, you'll need an external machine (or a VM) with
CoovaChilli installed. Your Linksys device can only act as an access point
in this case.


Regards
Gergely Kiss

Hi David

Thanks for the new release, i particularly like some of the more verbose log
messaging and the RadSec changes ;)

I'm trying to build coova-chilli for coova-ap (whiterussian rev 9287)

I get the following error when building:

My build environment

Using built-in specs.
Target: i486-linux-gnu
Configured with: ../src/configure -v --with-pkgversion='Debian 4.3.2-1.1'

Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.3.2 (Debian 4.3.2-1.1)

I don't get this error when compiling coova-chilli 1.2.2 in the same
environment. The error can be bypassed if i comment out lines 555-557 of
main-redir.c, think the object vars are out of scope or just not declared?

Subject: [Chilli] Help with chilli_radconfig
Message-ID: <AANLkTik=EPpBVasPvLzfe7SFVb=qzVkMc-vn9S=UTEJn@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've installed CoovaAP (1.0 beta 9) on my wrt54gl. When I run
chilli_radconfig I've got a segmentation fault.
I've migrate to openwrt (10.03) with provided package for coova-chilli and
same error.
I've recompiled coova-chilli 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 and same error.
I've then migrate to openwrt 10.03 kernel 2.6 and still same error.

The segmentation fault happens only when running a real request with
--adminuser and --adminpasswd parameters. If I run chilli_radconfig
--version or --help then it works.

Is there anyone using chilli_radconfig on wrt54gl ? How can I have it to
work ?

Linksys WRT54GL v1.1
CoovaAP 1.0 - beta 09
OpenWrt 10.03 bcrm-2-4
OpenWrt 10.03 bcrm47xxx

Coova-chilli 1.2.2
Coova-chilli 1.2.3


Thks & Rgds,
Ethariel

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=vfw-wOt5AdWzYiPVB_hWSri2Qd1yModDSeD1x@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, my customer is reporting a cpu problem.

Chilli goes to consume all the processor, going to 100%.

It is a brand new setup, bult on a VMWare ESXi Virtual Machine on HP ML115,
1.8GHz CPU allocated,
512MB RAM allocated,
coova-chilli 1.2.2,
Ubuntu 9.10 ( 2.6.31-14-server ).

It's about three times it happens, solved it with a reboot.

Very few clients, < 10.

Suggestions ?

How can i investigate and understand when it happens ?

Thank i.a.

Best regards,

Marco

How quickly does this start to happen? Immediately? After how long? 

Is chilli also not working during this time? Does chilli_query hang? 

Are you able to attach gdb or use strace to get more info? 

If able, you can try running in debug mode for additional log
information? 

Thanks,
David

Are you using WISPr/smart clients, or do you use SSL?

Wichert asked a good question; are you using SSL features of
CoovaChilli? 

For info on gdb, you can google for it, of course. Here is a quick howto
page:
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/developers-handbook/debugging.html

For strace, use "strace -p <pid>" and you will see the system calls
being executed - if it is using 100%, there must be a runaway loop
occurring.
