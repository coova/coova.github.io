<PRE>Hi All,

I would like to ask a beginner's question on acctupdate option in Coova. I know this has been asked/answered many times but I still can't get it right. My setup is Coova, FreeRadius (with daloRadius) and MySQL. 

I am trying to set up an ISP environment which will bill customers based on usage (ChilliSpot-Max-Total-Octets). Most customers will be prepaid users. The issue I still can't resolve is how to update a user's data quota (MB) if he tops up his account mid-session. I don't want to terminate a user's session to get the updated data quota for him. After much reading, Radius' CoA messages and Coova's own acctupdate option are most probable solutions. I wish to try acctupdate first because it looks simpler than setting up CoA.

&gt;<i>From the changelog, acctupdate &quot;will allow for session parameter updates with RADIUS Accounting-Response&quot;. From David's reply in the mailing list - &quot;the acctupdate option means that accounting responses from the radius server may have session parameter options like bandwidth and time limits. In a way, it is the poor man's CoA which is useful for when you do not have a direct route back to the router to use CoA.&quot; Does it mean that Coova will recofigure session attributes at every interim accounting update?
</I>
How does one go about configuring acctupdate after enabling it in the config file? Is there any change necessary in FreeRadius? (Sorry, I am also new to FreeRadius.) I specified ChilliSpot-Max-Total-Octets as a radreply attribute for a user. With debug messages, I could see that cb_radius_acct_conf function is called many times during a user's session but changing ChilliSpot-Max-Total-Octets in MySQL (mid-session) doesn't reconfigure that session attribute in Coova. I also tried putting ChilliSpot-Max-Total-Octets as a radcheck attribute but that session attribute doesn't even get set with that value.

Please enlighten me which settings I am missing.

Thanks so much.

Regards,
Phyo Wai Soe
