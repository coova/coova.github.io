<PRE>Hi guys,

I have some doubts regarding how coova will handle routing between multiple
interfaces in the controller. Is there someone with a similar design that
could help me?

My controller has 04 interfaces:

- eth0 WAN
- eth1 LAN SERVICES
- eth2 LAN SUBSCRIBER - AP 01
- eth3 LAN SUBSCRIBER - AP 02

I Would like to connect AP-01 and AP-02 in eth2 and eth3. Coova will
deliver DHCP address on network 172.16.0.0

eth0 is directly connected to internet with a valid IP address.

eth1 has an address 10.1.0.0 which is used for services (log management,
server monitoring, backups, etc..).

My questions are:

1) When the AP is handed an IP address by coova (172.16.0.100), hosts on
the service LAN (eg, 10.1.0.7) can ping and access the AP which is what I
want. But if define a static IP (172.16.0.10) they no longer can access the
AP. In both cases the AP was not authenticated by coova (users device
however does). Why?

2) The AP is forwarding syslog messages to the Coova Controller at
(172.16.0.1) at UDP 514 and the syslog is configure to forward to a
logserver over internet. I can see the message coming in at the tun
interface but it is never dispatched to the logserver. Could t be Coova
stoping it? How do I open up an UDP port on coova?

3) eth2 and eth3 are configured as &quot;auto ethX&quot; but has no address/netmask
defined for them. Is this correct?

4) Can I add network address (say, from the services network) for the AP
wired IF, eth2 and eth3? would coova still delivering DHCP address at
172.16.X.X for client devices and working properly?

Thanks for the information.

Cheers,
