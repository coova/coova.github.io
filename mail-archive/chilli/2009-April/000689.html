<PRE>Hi all,


After a long study of coova-chilli, i am very enjoy this great software. And
I really want to contributed some code to it.
though I am a new to software develop.

Coova-chilli, organize the shell script and c together, also include
bstring, tun interface to ifconfig, gengetopt, autotools, iptables.
maybe u are all familiar with GNU software, but I study such tools in
Coova-chilli first time.

also the coova-chilli has many form in different platform, openwrt
,openmoko(sorry for its news).
and python support also appeared in it.


of course, I am not strong to support coova-chilli, but maybe you all can
figure me a right way to contribute.
what I know first is to get more familiar with the source code.

thanks.


btw, sorry  for my english
=P
