<PRE>Ouch, I missed the news about openmoko. Damn, I just bought a neorunner
and now it's end-of-life. Figures....

So much for Open phones... The Openmoko port is a nice little package
which uses the python script for configuration. I'm planning on making
that python GUI more general, for all platforms.

Thanks for offering your support. Though, Chilli isn't the best place,
perhaps, to learn programming. 

One way you can help is to spread truthfully and good things about
Coova, to counter balance a small group of people who like to go around
telling negative lies about Coova.

Thanks,
David
