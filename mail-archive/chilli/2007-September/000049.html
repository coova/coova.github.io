<PRE>Ok, was too eager to try the svn update so I came back to test anyway. 
Your latest update works great! Thanks. Especially since I imagine my 
DHCP relay configuration is rather unusual :)

May I bug you with one more item. This is not show stopper but 
nevertheless something that bothers me. I can ping across chillispot 
just fine. But if the clients ping chillispot IP itself, they get 
duplicate replies. I.e. 1 echo-request, 2 echo-replies come back. This 
is the case for both wired and wireless clients (so it is not a 
quirkness of the WLC in my environment).

The tcpdump at the client, chillispot's tun interface and chillispot's 
dhcpif interface shows the duplicate echo-replies. The tun interface 
capture does show something odd: There is actually an echo-reply going 
out first, then the echo-request in, then echo-reply out. I can send the

I can send you the tcpdump if needed :)

.lzs
