<PRE>Hi,

I made this post in the forums, but I thought i'd also put here in the
mailing list.

I have been using MAC_AUTH successfully for a number of months with
CoovaChilli 1.2.5.

I've now decided that I want to give certain users specific IP addresses
outside of the scope of the CoovaChiili network.

I set RADIUS to return an IP address in the Framed-IP-Address attribute. My
access accept message now looks like this:

Packet-Type = Access-Accept
Idle-Timeout = 120
Acct-Interim-Interval = 60
Session-Timeout = 86400
WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Down = 1024000
WISPr-Bandwidth-Max-Up = 256000
Framed-IP-Address = 11.22.33.44

The IP address was assigned correctly. However, because this is an address
outside of the CoovaChilli network scope I needed a different subnet mask
too.

I couldn't see the attribute Framed-IP-Netmask in the man page for
chilli-radius but I did see in other people's implementations online.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work. I still get given the correct IP but
the Framed-IP-Netmask attribute is ignored.

I looked through the source code a little and I saw that the attribute did
seem to be at least defined, but it doesn't seem to be used.

Is there any plan to add the full functionality of this attribute in the
future?
