<PRE>Ok, some testing done.
Apparently setting uamuiport doesn't play so nicely if something is
already running on that port (like apache). It's fine if you are going
to have an inetd style webserver launched via chilli, but not so good
otherwise.
But, I am at the right part of the code. Essentially, we could add a
bit more code that lists a number of ports to the local server, that
shouldn't be counted or &quot;leaky bucketed&quot;. For now, I've just added one
port, and hard coded it in, port 80. But adding it as a list of ports,
and not hard coded but configurable on the command line and config
files, shouldn't be too much harder.

I've attached my patch.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You'd also set uamuiport in your config files to be what ever port

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> If it works, I'll submit the patch.
