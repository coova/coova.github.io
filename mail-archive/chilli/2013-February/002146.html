<PRE>Hi,

 

First of all, sorry for over complicating it.

I've got that option already on the confi, sorry for not mentioning it.
Also, for paypal http content, it work good. The problem is with https. At
the moment, is some of the chilli instances it is working, and in others is
not.

I've put

HS_UAMDOMAINS=.paypal.com,.paypalobjects.com,etc.

Also

uamallowed      &quot;paypal IP's range.&quot;

also

uamdomain .paypal.com

uamdomain .paypalobjects.com

 

could my problem be from putting it in 3 places (hs_uamdomains, uamallowed
and uamdomain)?

 

Regards,

Luis

 

 

You're over complicating it. This has been a problem for a long time and
CoovaChilll has a work around built in.

HS_UAMDOMAINS=&quot;.paypal.com,.paypalobjects.com&quot;

Set that and CoovaChilli will resolve the domains and allow the result. IIRC
it also hijacks all the clients DNS so it will only be allowed IP.

 

Hi everyone,

 I've got a problem with allowing paypal to our clients either using
uamdomain our uamallowed. Paypal has several IP ranges, and it does load
balance between them. I've put the full range of ip's on the config, so
that's not the issue, but it does not work all the time.

My question is how does chilli work with dns resolution?

It is because I see that paypal works good during like 12-24 hours, but then
stop working properly and locking the new ip ranges that paypal start using.
And after a couple of hours, it start work again. 

Does chilli makes a dns resolution only once or every now and then?

Could it be that using layer3 is the cause of chilli locking access to
paypal.com?

Is it possible to configure paypal access using some other option besides
uamdomain and uamallowed?

 

Coova-chilli-1.2.9 on Layer3

CentOS 3.0
