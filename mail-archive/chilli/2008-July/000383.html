<PRE>I'm having a tough time getting stability on a test WDS setup using
CoovaAP (0.9).

When I do get it to work, I find I can't do the following:

1. I can't ping one router from the other's console. (However, I can
successfully ping both from a client PC connected to either router)

 (NOTE: I've  discovered that I can ARPing from the Host Router to the
Repeater, from br0 (like so: &quot;arping -I br0 192.168.182.2&quot;, but NOT
vice versa!)

2. Obviously, not being able to ping, I also can't ssh from one router
to the other (though I can ssh into either from a client PC connected
to either)

Why is this?

How can I check the status of my WDS links? (and possibly try to
re-initiate a link if it appears to be down...)

I also find that if the Host Router gets power cycled, the WDS link
appears to go down.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Henk
