[Separate] DHCP server should not take on Chilli's assigned network.
Chilli has its own dhcp leasing part as a daemon, if you use a DHCP as
well you may have conflicts. Technically it's a DHCP server as well but
it's obvious that it's not only doing just that (usually it establishes
so called "sessions" [not really accurate] on MAC address upon leasing).

Also it is not a Web Proxy, so if you want to filter HTTP requests via
squid you may want to assign the priority based on what you need, I
would do it before getting to Chilli (so Client -> Squid -> Chilli).
Normally, if you want to have it on the same server, you would first
DNAT the HTTP(S) traffic to Squid itself then it should normally go to
Chilli however leasing an IP should still work (meaning, Squid should
only filter HTTP traffic and not block anything when the client would
want an IP joining the Hotspot network).

I hope I answered as best as possible, sorry if maybe is a bit out of
the scope.
