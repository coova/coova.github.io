<PRE>Hi all

I've been trying to figure out how to get this issue solved for some time, hopefully this is the right forum.

I'm running CoovaChilli on OpenWRT Barrier Breaker (trunk). The miniportal's wwwsh wrapper does not seem to have the client's POST response to login.chi either in stdin or as a shell variable which haserl is expecting to see when handling login.chi. As a result, the connection is terminated as soon as login.chi fails, citing a lack of input.

A packet trace shows POST data in the client's submission of 106 bytes, and a shell variable CONTENT_LENGTH inside the wwwsh image also 106 bytes, but the actual POST data is neither in stdin nor any shell variable. From my limited knowledge of C I can't see how this is ever submitted to the execv calling _options.wwwbin, so I have no idea where else to look.

All other functions appear to be working fine - DHCP, DNS forwarding, even opening the status.chi page and authenticating there passes to RADIUS just fine (that script has no stdin requirement apparently).

This is the last piece before I declare everything functional and can start rollout, and I've kept all my changes ready to publish to upstream to both OpenWRT and anyone else so I'm keen to get this solved.
