&gt;<i> It sounds like your APs will be in bridge mode?
</I>
	Not really. :)

	We are using a bunch of 3Com OfficeConnect
Wireless 54Mbps 11g (Model: WL-524), when we first
deployed them we were going to use static IPs,
defining it manually on each AP, the discussion led
us to the decision of use DHCP and based on the MAC
addresses give &quot;static IPs&quot;.

	In that sense, APs are not in bridge mode,
but we don't expect them to navigate or anything
like that, my plan is jut to have access to their
management interfaces remotely.


&gt;<i> Either way, it isn't obvious really what solution
</I>&gt;<i> is the &quot;right&quot; one. Changes are, you could have
</I>&gt;<i> some options how you set it up.
</I>
	I was imagining something along those lines.


&gt;<i> If you are going to use Framed-IP-Address in MAC
</I>&gt;<i> auth, then you will also need the option (in
</I>&gt;<i> chilli 1.2.0) --strictmacauth ... this option was
</I>&gt;<i> added to keep chilli doing what it does now: when
</I>&gt;<i> DHCP request comes in, the first one is ignored
</I>&gt;<i> while RADIUS is performed for MAC authentication.
</I>&gt;<i> The DHCP is ignored, because chilli *might* learn
</I>&gt;<i> of the correct IP to return from RADIUS. This,
</I>&gt;<i> however, makes all clients connect a bit slower...
</I>&gt;<i> as they all have to reissue a DHCP request after
</I>&gt;<i> a timeout. Chilli was changed per default to just
</I>&gt;<i> return the DHCP reply without waiting (MAC auth
</I>&gt;<i> still happens, just after the client has an IP,
</I>&gt;<i> which means Framed-IP-Address in MAC auth now
</I>&gt;<i> requires the new option).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this is clear.
</I>
	This is clear, but it raises another question. :)

	We have a very particular setting here, we
provide Free Wi-Fi service to the company area (which,
BTW, is a hospital) using CoovaChilli, the idea is that
employees, patients, families and guests can use free
internet, for that reason we basically have a single
user and a modified captive portal that just requires a
click.

	If I understood correctly, when I opt for
macauth the MAC addresses are used as users for RADIUS
and that is not what I want based on the previous
scenario, considering that I didn't like to waste some
address because of the range allocation (statip/dynip)
I'm inclined to use macallowed, that will mix the fixed
IP addresses with the single user web auth, and
eventually, if the company decides to auth more users
or limit some of them, the &quot;mixed&quot; solution still work.
Does it sound like a good plan? (At least until the
new options similar to ethers come to production).

Kind regards,
