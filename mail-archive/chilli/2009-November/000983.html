I concur, it should be removed. I tested my patched code with &quot;truly 
static IP's&quot; and it still works fine without it (full connection 
allocated, times out after default 600 seconds &quot;lease&quot; time etc.). I've 
done hundreds of static IP mixed with dynamic IP setups in the past with 
1.0.11 (where that code wasn't in) and never had an issue. That piece of 
code is not required and it looks as though it never was (I thought you 
introduced it in a later version to make a particular new feature work).

Not sure if I still have commit access but I'm happy to commit this 
change and take credit ;-)
