<PRE>&gt;<i>From the sounds of it, I need to take full credit; for the bug! :) 
</I>
I have no issue giving you write access, though I already made the
change to my copy. I actually have some major changes to commit in my
working copy... Send me a htpasswd entry for yourself (privately) and
I'll configure you in subversion. 

Some highlights of things in development (or at least areas of
research);

- Went (back) to a globally static _options struct to get rid of many
functions calls

- A helper server called 'chilli_proxy' (already in svn; compile with
--enable-chilliproxy) that does a RADIUS&lt;-&gt;HTTP conversion
(<A HREF="http://www.coova.org/CoovaChilli/Proxy">http://www.coova.org/CoovaChilli/Proxy</A>)

- Breaking out a server called 'chilli_redir' (enabled with configure
--enable-chilliredir) that will do the UAM server functions broken out
from the main chilli program. This opens the door for additional
processing of the hijacked URL - like for doing a URL based walled
garden (to allow www.google.com, but not www.google.com/mail for
instance). 

- Reworked the chilli_main() heavily making it like a &quot;plug-in&quot; style
registration of listeners/handlers.

- Adding support for poll() and epoll() as alternatives to select()

- Testing the &quot;packet mmap&quot; features of Linux 2.6.31 (mmap &quot;ring&quot;
buffers for both RX and TX for &quot;zero-copy&quot; in/out to/from kernel/user
space; though still the issue/bottleneck of the tun/tap)

- A haserl &quot;miniportal&quot; taken from CoovaAP now part of coova-chilli
standard distro (build with --enable-miniportal)

- Some fixups in the &quot;routeidx/routeif&quot; features of chilli whereby
chilli can directly (through a raw socket) tap into multiple WAN
interfaces and can route user session data between them. Used with RX/TX
rings, this can be used to bypass the tun/tap completely for
authenticated traffic and doubles the throughput on my fonera ;)

- Experimenting on a Linux kernel module that can do the above
(bypassing chilli for authenticated traffic) directly in the kernel
instead of user space. 

Lots to come... ;) Developers and testers wanted!
