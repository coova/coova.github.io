Would you mind implementing that please? It would take me weeks to do it...

I know the current setup is secure enough. It's just that almost all of 
the most recent browsers out there give you nasty or at least very 
annoying warnings that some parts of the site are unsecured (http to 
chilli) and explaining security to users using tech talk is of little 
comfort, for a layman at least. On top of that, mixing https with plain 
http makes things really challenging with some javascript libraries. 
They all recommend to not mix at all.

Ok, please explain how I could use &quot;a relay&quot; to achieve what I need.

Am I right that it cannot be made to work with stunnel/matrixtunnel/xrelayd?
