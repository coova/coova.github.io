</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - Access-Accept (Full access)
</I>&gt;<i>     - Access-Accept + &quot;require UAM&quot; or Splash option
</I>&gt;<i>     - Access-Reject (Zero access)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be an option, not the default. The default will remain as 
</I>&gt;<i> it... which is that a reject still gives walled garden access during 
</I>&gt;<i> MAC auth.
</I>I see, sorry, I didn't understand fully what you were trying to achieve, 
now I do. However, I would still say if you want to block a given MAC 
permanently at least you should tell them why they're blocked, something 
that can only be done through UAM as some sort of visual/textual 
feedback on the splash page.

Hmm, come to think of it, UAM blocking would still allow them walled 
garden access, something one might want to block entirely indeed.

In any case, I think such a use case is still too advanced for our setup 
but I'm sure others will find it very useful.
