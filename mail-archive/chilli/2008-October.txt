Message-ID: <81237f640810190314v7c3e87edi346b8bdabf1532ad@mail.gmail.com>

Hey guys,

I was wondering if any of you are enforcing volume/traffic limiting such as
monthly total upload/download? (AcctInputOctets/AcctOutputOctets)
Which are attribute are you using for it? Does coovachilli disconnects the
session when this quota has reached or the user may go beyond
the quota but his next session authentication request will be rejected
because of FreeRADIUS's sqlcounter module?


Thanks in advance.

I'm working for the past weeks on adding billing functionality to daloRADIUS
so it would be good help
if you could help me design it. The first step would be knowing what kind of
billing are you looking for,
how are you doing your billing today? what are your expectations from the
billing system? etc...

I have already added to daloRADIUS a portal for PayPal Signup which means
the user signs-up using his
paypal account to purchase plans on your hotspot and the user is
automatically provisioned in the database
for authentication and the rest of it...


Regards,

And which attributes are you using for the upload/download or total traffic
enforcement?

Well there's the Chillispot-Max-Total-Octets attribute but if
chillispot/coovachilli doesn't track the octets count
and doesn't disconnect the user when the limit has reached then what's the
use for it? I can just use an internal
sqlcounter attribute in freeradius.

Any comments on that?

You can limit on data up/down. You'd *also* want to deny subsequent

Ahh, so disconnection upon quota reach is supported. Was that not supported
on the original chilli or what?
Cause it seems Outback confused me regarding this.

Thanks.

Subject: tap and vlan
Message-ID: <55166.139.179.14.250.1224834182.squirrel@webmail.bilkent.edu.tr>

Hello,
In our campus, we wanted to test TAP instead of tun.
And we found out something.Maybe a bug, or a thing that should not 
suppose to do.


Normally,
when we use usetap parameter in normal coova configurations, everything
works fine.

But if we try to run chilli on a vlan interface with usetap parameter,
Clients can able to get their ip addresses via coova but, unable to go
anywhere beyond, seems like can not get tagged by vlan. But if we tcpdump
on vlan interface we see the packets.So it should be ok till kernel level.

I am wondering what can cause this.. A bug in chilli-coova or in kernel
level..

The usetap option has always been highly experimental and largely
useless. A while back there was a bug with certain features that was
worked around using usetap, which has been fixed (the details I would
have to lookup). Using a tap doesn't make much sense, at the end of the
day. You want to use the tun interface so that the kernel has the
ability to route the packet appropriately, out through the default
gateway if not a local destination. However, with a tap, chilli would
have to figure out if the destination is local or not before deciding on
the destination MAC address. 

I'm interested to know what doesn't work when you use a tun interface
(assuming you are using at least chilli 1.0.12, or even better, the svn
version) and why the tap is required in your environment.

Hi David and thank you for your fast reply.
Actually, in some parts of our network we were still using chillispot 1.1
not coova-chilli. And in that areas, we were observing some packets on
physical interface which chilli runs which suppose to belong to network
behind tun interface.We can see this packets both on arp table of this
physical interface and and also with tcpdump command.And this mac-ids that
we saw on the physical part mostly belongs to the users creating huge
amounts of packets or connections like torrent or emule users.
And we thought maybe tun is not able to deal with such high amount of
packets and , when we figure out we can use tap instead of tun, maybe
working on layer 2 might help our situation.
Actually i cant say i tested coova-chilli tun performance in such parts of
our network yet.And even not sure if it is about chilli or tun driver
itself on kernel. Just testing..

Hello,
In one of the servers i installed coova-chilli (which has vlan interfaces)
 i noticed that the upload and download octet counters are switched.
Before i was using chilli on same computer but now, i dont know why, after
upgrading to coova-chilli it seems like the octets swithed.I see the
upload octets on download octets table and vice versa..
Is there an option to change it back?

Hello,
Can somebody explain me how WISPr XMl works? And how can i enable coovasx
or coovafx? Is there any seperate login page that i should enable for WIPr
logins?
As i make some tests, coovafx shows the name of the coovachilli, but can
not login. But after i manually login to the site via webpage , it starts
counting online time and also shows data statistics...

I searched for the documents actually for a detiled setup process for
chilli xml but http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli/UAMService  is
empty.
Any help would be great.
