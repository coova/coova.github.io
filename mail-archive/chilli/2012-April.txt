Subject: [Chilli] small project im working on SESSION management for iptables
Message-ID: <4F85389E.1060402@distrotech.co.za>

Hi all

we have been shipping chilli with our distro for a while now not 
something that is a core feature till
now there is a demand from one customer for multi site hotspots..

for this its awesome.

there is one other application that leans towards something else that 
chilli overlaps that is authorised
access based on 802.1x [hostapd in our case] where users are not allowed 
ip till authorized this is
possible on some higher end switches.

i have been putting a iptables target together SESSION that will allow 
traffic based on session paramaters
time/idle/packets/bytes[i+o] a session is crearted by opening and 
writing to a /dev/file all sessions can be
displayed via a /proc/net file.

once done the idea will be to have the session read from the dev file 
for accounting purposes.

i may patch chilli to use this and will publish this if there is any 
intrest.

Greg

Hi David,

The main problem is that you must have a linkedin account for access to the
group. Certainly, there are a lot of spam in the forum but I think that
list it is a good option, also.

There are ways to limit spammers, I've fought them in large forums before, and it's down to a combination of barriers, eg:

- Captcha at signup (duh)
- Restricted posting rights for the first 30 days / 15 posts, whichever comes sooner, eg. only allowed to post in a newbies section.
- Alternative or combined with the previous, moderation of posts.
- Restrictions on content posted during the first 15 posts, eg. no URLs, images, or customized signatures.

These are very easy to do with vBulletin, not sure what the forum runs on.

Cheers,

Mike

Message-ID: <48070336.154171.1334157212045.JavaMail.root@quaglia>

I'd like to make some dynamic free hotspot, that would mean an user connects to it and visits the login page I insert the relevant information for mac auth, but then the dhcp should be refreshed in order to authenticate the mac address and allow navigation. 
So, theorically, if the client makes a new dhcp request it should be authenticated.

I've done some searches but didn't find a way to do that. A possible solution I came up to is to make a JSON login using macauth credentials. 
Can this be accomplished? Any better solution?

I just need to make "transparent" login, the user shouldn't enter any credential to surf.

thanks

On first login, insert the data (MAC and anything you want) in a BD and 
use it with macallow function.

ok but to perform mac auth I need to disconnect the client from the network and reconnect it, in order to issue a new mac auth.

Also, when I create a new mac auth user I need to set the HS_MACALLOW parameter in chilli.conf... How can I do this? Maybe even on a CoovaAP router?

thanks again

You can handle it on freeradius. Enable the function and see what are 
happening on freeradius.

You can use macreauth so that chilli performs a mac auth without the user
having to disconnect/reconnect to the network.

I still have one doubt: mac auth requires a list of mac addresses in config files to be specified.
I can add a mac to the radius database dynamically, but then I'd need to adjust coova config, do I?

oh, I now see HS_MACAUTHMODE which allows to use radius for mac list, instead of local HS_MACALLOWED user list.

Message-ID: <4F8D6579.30005@gmail.com>

Dear all

I configured coovachilli 1.2.8 with approximately 1000 online user. but 
coova in one time per day start to use 100% cpu and generate large log 
same as below

Apr 17 15:35:35 localhost coova-chilli[2423]: net.c: 756: data 
truncated, sending ICMP error -1/65535
Apr 17 15:35:35 localhost coova-chilli[2423]: net.c: 756: data 
truncated, sending ICMP error -1/65535
Apr 17 15:35:35 localhost coova-chilli[2423]: net.c: 756: data 
truncated, sending ICMP error -1/65535

I think it generate 60000 line log per every second. rsyslog take 80% 
cpu for writing it! our bandwidth is 200Mb/s

when i killed chilli it send this log to log file:

Apr 17 15:36:09 localhost coova-chilli[2423]: radius.c: 226: radius 
queue is full!
Apr 17 15:36:09 localhost coova-chilli[2423]: radius.c: 226: radius

I check radius service and it was ok at that time! we are using

hi.
I've set up a prelogin portal which then redirects to http://uamip:uamport/prelogin 
The problem is that my portal is multilanguage, and I don't know how to retain the language after passing the prelogin url. Parameters are not passed along after prelogin, and I cannot use cookies because the prelogin portal and the login page are on different domains.

Any suggestion?
thanks

  I've setup coovachilli - freeradius and works fine.

I wan't to give access to users without authentication. Just to land on 
welcome page and consider authondicated.
Is it possible to accomplise that? In other words, is it possible to 
have a predifined username and password into freeradius and force each 
new user, after he get an ip from coovachilli to automatically 
authondicated by these credentials without a login form?

Thanks in advanced!

Not sure I understand. You want to enforce restrictions on an 802.1x network? Chilli can already do that when using it to proxy hostapd RADIUS (and controlling a bridge that includes the 1x network) .

Hi all

we have been shipping chilli with our distro for a while now not 
something that is a core feature till
now there is a demand from one customer for multi site hotspots..

for this its awesome.

there is one other application that leans towards something else that 
chilli overlaps that is authorised
access based on 802.1x [hostapd in our case] where users are not allowed 
ip till authorized this is
possible on some higher end switches.

i have been putting a iptables target together SESSION that will allow 
traffic based on session paramaters
time/idle/packets/bytes[i+o] a session is crearted by opening and 
writing to a /dev/file all sessions can be
displayed via a /proc/net file.

once done the idea will be to have the session read from the dev file 
for accounting purposes.

i may patch chilli to use this and will publish this if there is any 
intrest.

Greg

I do not generally recommend the macreauth option as it generates a huge number of macauth to RADIUS - by design, but usually considered too much.

awesome, didn't know about that, thanks!

Message-ID: <20120429171900.911@citromail.hu>

 Hello All,

I would like to get the host name of the connected client. My plan was simple modify the source code of chilli, but as I suppose it is not the best way and anyway I have not idea how to do this. But I went ahead and I got deeper and deeper in this topic. Now I find that radius server perfectly can solve my problem. It is almost very good news, but I do not know how to receive the wished attributes from that. Maybe someone can give me some advice how I can do this.

But I simple do not understand why the dhcp part cannot prove this information. I think where I use dhcp server I want to know about client there. And I do not want to depend on something else. But maybe this is only my consideration.

But the main point is now I would be really glad of getting some help in question of getting hostname. :)

Nice day,

Tamas

Hi Tam?s,

David wrote an article about using vendor-specific attributes to be
able to get the DHCP options from the clients (including the client's
hostname):

http://www.coova.org/node/118

I don't know if it's still a proposal or has been implemented already,
but taking a quick look at the source tells me the proposed DHCP
attributes are already included in the dictionary file:

http://dev.coova.org/svn/coova-chilli/doc/dictionary.chillispot

On the other hand, it seems the code does not use these attributes
anywhere, so I think you will need to change the source to get the
hostname as a RADIUS access request attribute.

Unfortunately, I'm not good enough at C++ programming to do the
coding, but basically you just need to fetch the hostname from the
DHCP request (DHCP option 12), store it in a property and pass it to
the RADIUS server when sending an access request packet during
authentication.


Regards,
Gergely Kiss

Ps. ?n is magyar vagyok! :)
