Subject: [Chilli] Coova-Chilli WISPr problem
Message-ID: <CAHnB-A-CAt2GGVYL6=+uYC1k-ch7Wq9fxmMAtsMjv2NY+5wYxA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

i installed a coova-chilli 1.2.6 gateway on ubuntu and "its working
ok", clients can access the internet after they manually authenticate
to chilli.
My problem is chilli its not sending WISPr related XML, so no
automatic login for clients supporting WISPr.

i tried using the embedded captive portal and also the
hotspotlogin.cgi without success.

please any hints on what i'm missing,

thanks in advance,

Message-ID: <1736800460.129026.1310495757460.JavaMail.open-xchange@oxltgw05.schlund.de>

Dear all,
?
when I try to compile coova-chilli-1.2.7 (or 1.2.8 now) through OpenWRT
buildroot, I get an error saying that
?
cc1: warnings being treated as errors
ssl.c: In function '_openssl_env_init':
ssl.c:197:15: error: assignment discards qualifiers from pointer target type
ssl.c: In function 'openssl_check_accept':
ssl.c:395:11: error: assignment discards qualifiers from pointer target type
?
and thus compilation fails and aborts.
I'm by no means a C expert, so if anyone could tell me what to do, or has a
patch for those two lines, I'd greatly appreciate it.
Best regards
Frank

Subject: [Chilli] Questions concerning large scale deployment of coova chilli
Message-ID: <4E1CD2EE.4010004@unwired.at>

Dear All,

Thanks for the great work so far and for the contineous development of 
Coova Chilli. We've been using wifidog so far and we're thinking about 
using coova in a large scale open source project. Thus we do have a few 
questions concerning coova chilli. A few facts about the planned setup:

- one central uplink with a core2quad, 8gb ram debian squeeze server for 
nat/firewalling/captive portal/openvpn termination
- 300 to up to  3000 openwrt based access points connecting to the 
server via openvpn layer 2 tunnel

How would you setup coova to satisfy these requirements - we've tested a 
little bit and found out the following:

a) coova & openvpn kernel/userspace switching for each packet consumes a 
lot cpu (much more than e.g. l2tp tunneling in kernel mode) - is there 
any kind of optimization, multi processor support etc?

b) a pentium 4 3ghz single core without hyperthreading can server around 
120 mbit with coova and openvpn running until maxxed out - do you have 
conducted similar tests and if yes what was the result - I could only 
find an entry on the mailinglist mentioning max. 1000 ap's on a single 
server

c) how do you work around the limitations of briding tables (max 1024 
devices on linux bridge and openvpn bridge)  if you have lot's of vpn 
interfaces - can you cascade bridges and coova chilli will still work?

d) we use layer2  tunnels (with client isolation on wlan and openvpn) to 
allow wifi clients to roam between access points. Coova chilli is 
installed centrally, not on the access points. How should we setup Coova 
to handle max 26000 devices (macs) and provide dhcp service

e) splash pages for the clients need to be regionalized - thus groups of 
ap's present a certain login page - we thus need to know which ap the 
client is on and when it is roaming - currently we get this information 
from openvpn - you mention in your blog that certain enterprise ap's can 
talk to chilli using radius and update chilli about the events - would 
that work with hostapd on openwrt too or what solution do you propose to 
personalize based on the ap a client comes from

f) what is the management interface of your choice for managing the 
freeradius db in mysql - currently we try daloradius - it is great, just 
not useful for the enduser administrator creating a new access point

Thank you for your answers and opinions!

thanks,
Alexander

Hello. Has anyone been able to make coova 1.2.5 or later work with Fedora's
RPM? I have created my own and it does not work on Fedora 8. Apparently it
does not create the coova daemon  and it cannot find the appropriate
folders. Here is the error that it gives me:
chilli: which: no start-stop-daemon in
(/usr/kerberos/sbin:/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/root/bin)

I have checked and in those folders there are chilli files, or at least
files with that name. Also I tried the dpkg solution and still no luck .
Thank you

Assuming EAP-SIM authentication is supported by hostapd, then is there a way to
integrate hostapd with coova chilli so that coova chilli will see the hostapd 

authenticated user as authenticated by coova chilli and continue to manage
the authorization and accounting things ?

Hi,

currently the site www.coova.org is a hard-coded entry in the walled garden
list. While I understand the wish to advertise the site, this should be
done using an overridable way or using a comment, but not by hard-coding
the access exception.

The attached patch simply removes www.coova.org from the walled garden.
Please consider it for inclusion.

Thanks,
Erik

since Squeeze, Debian GNU/Linux uses the LSB headers (see

Subject: [Chilli] hostapd radius accounting via coova chilli
Message-ID: <4E206587.8010700@unwired.at>

Dear all,

I've configured hostapd on an openwrt 10.03 backfire to access point to 
report via radius to coovachilli.

My goal is to have the connect/disconnect events of wlan clients 
available in chilli/radius db.

Hostapd is reporting properly (checked via tcpdump), but allways gets a 
"connection refused" when trying to reach coovachilli.

First I had chilli radiusproxy running on 1812/1813 and it conflicted 
with the local freeradius, but still on another port coovachilli does 
not seem to open the radiusproxy port.


Configuration on Chilli (/etc/chilli/default)

I think what you're after is a way of setting the DHCP pool so it  
doesn't use all the address space in your network.

e.g. ( in /etc/chilli/local.conf )

dhcpstart=10
dhcpend=254

Adam

Thank you Adam,

But it's not exactly what I'm after. What I need is to avoid chilli offering
specific IPs within the pool.

For example:
If my pool is 192.168.0.10-192.168.0.250 and I want to avoid chilli offering
192.168.0.50.

I think static host entries like the ones used in ISC dhcp can solve my
problem.

Caciano Machado

Dear All,

in my attempts to resolve the problems I got when compiling CoovaChilli
--with-openssl for the current OpenWRT trunk , I found out that
apparently there have been changes to the header files from OpenSSL
somewhere between 0.9.8 and 1.0.0.d.  Building OpenWRT trunk also
usually fetches the most recent OpenSSL source could and builds it.

I created a patch for CoovaChilli that worked for me, however: I'm a C
beginner and thus would kindly ask for anyone with some spare time to
review and test the attached patch.
Thanks in advance
Frank

According to this url link :-

http://coova.org/CoovaChilli/WPACaptivePortal :-

    *   a user presenting valid credentials get on-line without restriction while
    * a user presenting in-valid credentials will still gain WPA access, but be subject to a captive portal and walled garden.

I found that when a user is presented with in-valid credentials, the STA will continue to seek authentication rendering it impossible to get to a captive portal and walled garden.

Anyone has also tested this ?

Sorry please ignore my previous post as I haven't read the whole thing. It seems the support for this is not automatic, or rather, the radius server has to be configured/modified to accomplish this.

Regards.

No time for testing, sorry, but FWIW to me the patch looks good.

This causes the compile to abort, it would probably work anyway if warnings
were accepted (-Werror compiler flag treats warnings as errors). A warning
free build is a worthy goal to pursue, so I am in favour of the patch.

Based on this url, when a user presenting in-valid credentials will
still gain WPA access, but be subject to a captive portal and walled garden.

However I also found this url on the net :-

http://lists.cistron.nl/pipermail/freeradius-users/2011-June/msg00435.html

Basically it says it is not possible to change EAP reject to accept. 
So now my question is why is it possible for jradius to accomplish this ?
What is the trick which jradius does to get over this problem ?

Best regards.

Subject: [Chilli] VLAN based routing
Message-ID: <1311751446.62740.YahooMailClassic@web161425.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

Assuming coova chilli has 8021q enabled and it is happily managing traffic coming in from a few VLANs. Based on the VLAN input traffic, I would like to route it to different gateways.

Assuming the dhcp interface is eth0 and the tunnel interface is tun0. Now when the 8021q VLAN traffic comes in, is it appearing in tun0.VLAN_ID or
it is still just appearing in tun0 ? If I want to route them separately, I need to have a way to identify the traffic. How could this be accomplished ?

Regards
