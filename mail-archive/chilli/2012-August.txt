Message-ID: <22E7DE3A-FFD1-45FC-A3FD-5518D7A621A7@wicoms.com>

Hi list,

Has anyone succeeded in getting the Administrative-User session functionality fully working?

I have a test AP running an Adminstrative-User session fine (config is returned in Access-Accept and stored in a file). The config is written to non-default file (/tmp/foo) in line with my adminupdatefile setting. The session re-auths every hour and the config is re-written to my adminupdatefile at that time.

If I change the settings returned in radius what DOESN'T happen is these changes being recognised, copied to the chilli config file (hs.conf) and chilli HUP'd. 

This would be trivial to do manually via a script in cron, but it's my understanding that chilli should do this. Am I wrong or is this a bug do you think/know?

I have also not had any luck controlling the interval in which chilli re-auths the administrative-user session. I have tried setting HS_ADMININTERVAL and also returning a Session-Timeout value in the Access-Accept to no avail. Has anyone had any success controlling the session time?

I've included some debug output below for anyone that knows if this looks right or not. It appears that the config is saved in my adminupdatefile location and copied to /tmp/hs.conf rather than /etc/chilli/hs.conf (?)

Possibly relevant: I'm not using a call to writeconfg in my start script. I want to fully control the dns servers over radius. If I use writeconfig the dns1 attribute is set to the devices primary dns server (or one that I hardcode) and this is not overruled if I return a different server ip by radius config. Rather than find a way to patch the functions file I took the easy route of using a static main.conf and fetching the rest of the configuration over radius.

Many thanks in advance,
Adam

Be sure the adminupdatefile is also included into your chilli
configuration (using 'include <filename>').

Hi!

What is Administrative-User session for?

Thanks David,

My mistake was to use both the administrative-update session AND the radius config functionality at the same time (for reasons not worth going into). Confusion reigned. 

What wasn't clear to me was that you could forgo any RADCONF-esque functionality, not need to call radiusconfig in init, and just use the Administrative-User functionality when starting up with half the configuration on the device and the rest supplied centrally. All cleared up now.

@David - Can I control the amount of time between re authentication of the administrative user session or is it hard coded to an hour?

@Bojan - the administrative-user functionality allows you to host a subset of your configuration centrally (accessible via radius), to change that configuration at will and have it updated on all relevant chilli instances in a timely and automatic fashion.

Cheers,
Adam

You can have it re-auth based on the --interval option value.

Hi Dave,
As requested, built r473 from svn, build fails with following error, 
disabling IPv6 support or commenting out line 532 in pkt.h allows the 
build to complete sucessfully.

sounds like a simple if defined would fix that instead of the
commenting out viable code.

It would be best to change all the define's in pkt.h to something with a
prefix like pkt_ so that they don't conflict with standard headers...

Tested with latest amd64 snapshot, build fails with
tun.c:788: warning: 'tun_decaps_cb' defined but not used
Commenting out the code allows the build to continue but I've not been 
able to complete the build as I don't think gengetopt is currently in 
the OpenBSD ports tree at the moment.
