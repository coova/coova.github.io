Hi.
I get a HUGE problem with my two fresh coovachilli installation.
I made the same steps, and I realized two hotspot with transparent
proxy redirection. Both works well with http, but with https I get two
different problem: on the first hotspot https traffic is not forwarded
to squid, but go, in the second https traffic is not forwarded at all!
In this moment I am very confused and I can't provide more evidence...
Can anyone lead me to arguments related to coova and https?
Thank you very much!

I aplogize, i made a routing error on my next-hop router... now both
systems have the seme behaviour. By the way this also is a problem
for me: I need session to pass through the proxy, and actually it does
not happens!

Ok, I apologize again, I think it is a squid problem. I excluded chilli and
I can't get https log again...
Thank you for your patience :(

i've some troubles with modern browsers and the exit url.
in the past it was enough to set dns domain in dhcp and create an exit site to redirect to the logoff url.
right now if you type just "exit", most browsers use that as a search term, so they're redirected to google instead! 
this is very annoying on iOS, where the login page is popped up and then disappears. 

did anyone experience the same problem? how did you solve?
thanks

obviously typing exit.mydomain.com works ... but can be very long and annoying to type, for many users :(

Hi.

I'm using CoovaAP version 1.0 beta.12. I was testing Capitive Frame, I successfully enabled it but when I visit a page the header code tries to fetch the js from url:
http://1.0.0.1/cframe-js
but I modified my coova chilli ti serve on network 192.168.182.1, so it's not able to get the code, and the frame is not displayed!

How can I fix this?
thanks

comparing radius request with the old chillispot, I found out that Coova sends an Accounting-Request, while chillispot does a Access-Request. The latter contains the Session-Terminate-Time, while the first does not.

Why is Coova using Accounting-Request? How can I configure it to read WISPr-Session-Terminate-Time?

thanks

I was wrong...
The Access-Request is sent, the TerminateTime attribute is replied, then an Accounting-Request is sent!
The reply between the two requests is here:
Sending Access-Accept of id 2 to 192.168.1.205 port 2070
        WISPr-Session-Terminate-Time := "2012-06-06T14:58:00"

which was in the past at the time of the login (15:00).
So why Coova ignores it even if it's sent back? 

thanks

Subject: [Chilli] How to track invoicing
Message-ID: <CADbUV0TJPQoSBfp=osevxbd+SQiTaufzF_g+bVnK1-sXi4pmkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am currently tasked with customizing an existing Radius and Coovachilli
implementation.
Though I have a bit of PHP and C++ experience I am new to these 2
softwares/packages.

I am required to add a few attributes to the postpaid/prepaid user tables
and the same needs to get to the invoice tables related to Radius.

It is my understanding that coova makes an entry in the relevant invoicing
tables in Radius to track every time a client/user logs in and logs out.
What I am curious about is how does this happen? If I were to populate any
new details in the same table, what would be the best place to do it.

Any insight into Radius and Coova's communication regarding the same is
welcome.

Thanks for any help or pointer.

Thanks,
~Vikas

Hi.

I'm testing the CoovaChilli library, and I found a problem. All the communications are done in https, but when the JS library attempts login in http mode I get a warning on every browser saying I'm loading unsecure content!
AFAIK CoovaAP has no web SSL mode, so how can I avoid this message?

thanks

I'm using CoovaAP Firmware - version 1.0 beta.12 
I fear this option is not included...
How can I use custom coova options in coovaap?

thanks
