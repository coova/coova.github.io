Subject: Forwarding problem (DNS)
Message-ID: <49136792.1060206@ollisnet.de>

Hello,

we have setup multiple accesspoints using Chilli. Our clients gets a 
nameserver somewhere in the network, everything works fine.

Now we thought about to use dnsmasq on the access points directly to 
save some network traffic. We changed the chilli.conf dns1 & dns2 
setting to use the IP address of the access point running chilli itself.

In case a client authenticates successfully, it'll get an IP address 
assigned from chilli and will also get the IP address for the DNS server 
which is the access point's IP. When the client now tries to resolve a 
domain name, then DNS request will never be answered and resolving 
domain names will fail (no response).

First of all, we thought about a firewall problem, but the firewall 
doesn't list some packets which are dropped. After this we started 
chilli in debug mode to see what's going on on the network.

In an older version we saw the following when doing a sime ping to an 
outside IP address:

chilli.c: 2530: 0 (Success) cb_dhcp_data_ind. Packet received. DHCP 
authstate: 2
chilli.c: 1120: 0 (Success) cb_tun_ind. Packet received: Forwarding to 
link layer
chilli.c: 2530: 0 (Success) cb_dhcp_data_ind. Packet received. DHCP 
authstate: 2
chilli.c: 1120: 0 (Success) cb_tun_ind. Packet received: Forwarding to 
link layer

As you can see, chilli reports that the packed was forwared to the link 
layer. When doing a "nslookup somedomain.com" on the client the output 
was this:

chilli.c: 2530: 0 (Success) cb_dhcp_data_ind. Packet received. DHCP 
authstate: 2
chilli.c: 2530: 0 (Success) cb_dhcp_data_ind. Packet received. DHCP 
authstate: 2

No message "Forwarding to link layer" is logged. So I assumed that 
chilli get the DNS packet and drops it.

After that we tried to use a newer chilli version. I downloaded coova 
chilli 1.0.12, compiled it and installed it on the access point. Same 
scenario as described about and we'll get the following messages when 
doing a "nslookup somedomain.com" on the client:

dhcp.c: 1835: 0 (Debug) DHCP packet received
dhcp.c: 1865: 0 (Debug) Address found
chilli.c: 117: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 420, bucketup: 0, 
bucketdown: 100, up: 69, down: 0

After a short period, this messages repeats again. No more messages. 
When doing a simple ping to an outside IP address chilli logs the following:

dhcp.c: 1835: 0 (Debug) DHCP packet received
dhcp.c: 1865: 0 (Debug) Address found
chilli.c: 117: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 5, bucketup: 98, 
bucketdown: 84, up: 98, down: 0
chilli.c: 117: 0 (Debug) Leaky bucket timediff: 1, bucketup: 98, 
bucketdown: 0, up: 0, down: 84

So the problem is, that when using the access points IP (we tried the 
tun0 IP address and we tried the LAN IP address, both with same result), 
the DNS lookup will fail. When using an other DNS server (e.g. some 
public one) DNS lookup works fine.

Can anybody shed some light on it, why DNS lookup will fail when using 
the access point's IP address as DNS server?

Thanks for your help!

Kind regards
Oliver Hinckel

Subject: dynip and staticip
Message-ID: <59563.139.179.14.250.1226066290.squirrel@webmail.bilkent.edu.tr>

Hello,
What i am trying to do is, to create a small subnet on my network for
static ip devices like servers, ip cameras etc..and authenticate them with
mac-id.
As i see, dynip and statip settings are just for dhcp to distribute ip
addresses or not. What i wonder, is it able to prevent users to give
static ips from dynip range?
I mean if i give a subnet as dynip 192.168.182.1/255.255.255.128 and if a
user decides to give a static ip on 192.168.182.10, he is able to connect
to coova.How can i prevent them?

And i got ippool.c: 345: Static out of range error on syslog.
My config is basically like this..
net  192.168.182.0/255.255.255.0
dynip 192.168.182.1/255.255.255.128
statip 192.168.182.250/255.255.255.254

Everythings seem fine i think??

Or should i use only one option(dynip or statip) as Distribute from this
subnet(dynip) or do not distribute that subnet(statip)???

I'll check this later and report which rules are set up.

But are you able to reproduce this behaviour?

While i was trying to make coovafx-sx work, i noticed that we should use
the chilli.js for this support.

So, i copied it to my coova instlalation. made necessary settings for
index.html and chilli.js for my configuration and made the necessary path
settings on coova config file too.
And i restarted chilli.

That was cool to see the login page and also nice to see the coovafx
working..
But.. there was a little problem..
If i type a correct username/password it gives the error unknown username
or password.. But if i type anything else i could login to the system.

really strange to login with anything except the right user/pass couple.

PS: I also tested the radius config with radtest from the same server with
coova
It is working ok with it..And even if i change the uamlogin page to my old
cgi hotspotlogin page it works too..

I checked the firewall rules which seems to be OK. But I checked also 
the dnsmasq configuration which is running on the same machine running 
chilli.

It seems like a problem in the dnsmasq configuration. We changed the 
interface listening for DNS queries from eth1 (which is the physical 
radio network device) explicitely to tun0 (the chilli interface). With 
this configuration everything seems to be working fine.

I thought, I was already using such a configuration - that's why I asked 
here for a solution. But it seems something other got messed up and this 
configuration didn't worked well. But re-trying this again worked well.

Thanks anyway for your support!

It could be that dnsmasq is not listening on tun0 because tun0 was not
around when dnsmasq started. If your chilli "up.sh" script restarted
dnsmasq after starting chilli (and tun0), then you might have better
success.

I think i figured out the problem but not close to the solution.
As i see, hotspotlogin.cgi uses clean password.And even if i test with
radtest tool it authenticates with clean pass.
But, chilli.js uses chap authentication. And it is making some trouble for
me..
I left uamsecret empty as i read on previous posts..But didnt work.
So is there a way to disable chap and force the login page use clean
password?

Subject: chilli_query usage
Message-ID: <E914E3457D2A124085BDF8B8DF3AFFAD1A296B95@maui.internal.icomera.com>

Hi!

I'm having a bit of a problem with the usage of chilli_query. What I want to do is manually authenticate an IP-adress. (For users who can't display the captive portal.) Seems to me that this is what chilli_query is built for.

chilli_query authorizes the users just fine, but the sessiontimeout argument doesn't seem to work for me. Any suggestions?

The commands I'm using are:

chilli_query authorize ip 10.1.0.2 sessiontimeout 60 username testuser
This allows the ip adress 10.1.0.2 access, however chilli_query list shows:
<macadress> 10.1.0.2 pass <sessionid> 1 testuser 5/0 5/0 <originalurl>

The number indicating the sessiontimeout is 0, and it should be 60, right? The session also doesn't get disconnected after 60 seconds.

The sessions which are authorized through the captive portal shows up with a correct non-zero sessiontimeout value in chilli_query list.

Any ideas?

Thank you for your time.
/Andreas

Hi

I have set eth0 as 203.121.4.40

eth1 192.168.10.1

But when i login on the login page the remote Radius Server is receiving NAS
as 192.168.10.1

What are the modifications that i need to do to allow the remote Radius
Server to get 203.121.4.40

Cheers

If radius server sees client address as 192.168.x.x, you should check
your NAT configuration
in NAS. I Presume you are doing NAT on the NAS itself.

If you mean you see 192.168.x.x in radacct, that is normal. Because,
192.168.x.x is part of accounting request.

You can't confgure NAT in coova. You should setup NAT with iptables in NAS.

for example,

iptables -t nat -o eth0 -I POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

The above command will NAT all outgoing traffic on NAS running coova
with outgoing interface's IP address. You may have to fine tune your
firewall rules to allow outgoing traffic if they exist.

Venkatesh K

HI

So this operation would allow coova to send out packets from etho to eth1
203.121.4.40

Am i right?

What other changes in IP tablles i need to do to allow the remote radius
server to access 203.121.4.40

It is other way around. Coova packets from eth1 will be sent out on
eth0 with IP address set to 203.x.x.x. Again, assuming you have setup
a default gateway, which you would have done already.

It depends on your firewall configuration. If you can share with us
your firewall configuration, we can try to help you out.

Where is the error coming from? Not from chilli; I don't recognize the
error message.

There is an optional 'nasip' option.

Hello list,

I am hoping that someone already did a startup script for FreeBSD that they
can share. I am a new user to coova-chilli and just trying to wade through.
Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <991123400811161044y6a193c01w217249f7f1f33c07@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

Is there a nice little documentation on how to run coova-chilli on FreeBSD
somewhere?
I have crafted a startup script and on testing it, I get the following in
/var/log/messages:

Nov 16 21:27:57 FreeBSD-7 coova-chilli[50826]: net.c: 306: 17 (File exists)

I am wondering what I am missing at this point.

Don't know if there's a documentation for FreeBSD systems.

Seems that the network configuration is not correct.

Can you give us more information about your network setup (interface, 
ifconfig, ...)? The configuration file would also be helpful.

Well, I will contend with anything that will get me up and running:-)

Okay. Let me do that and also explain myself in the process:

My chilli.conf:

<begin>
[wash at FreeBSD-7 /usr/local/etc/chilli]$ less ../chilli.conf
#
#  Chilli Configuration
#
#  To configure chilli, see /usr/local/etc/chilli/default
#  and then create your own /usr/local/etc/chilli/config
#  start / stop chilli with @INITDIR@/chilli
#
#  For help with coova-chilli,
#       visit http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli
#
#  This file can either contain all your chilli configurations, or include
#  other files, as shown per default below. The idea here is that main.conf
#  contains your main configurations, hs.conf is for your configurations
#  delivered by RADIUS (using the Administrative-User login), and local.conf
#  is for any other settings you might configure by hand for this particular
#  installation.

include /usr/local/etc/chilli/main.conf
include /usr/local/etc/chilli/hs.conf
include /usr/local/etc/chilli/local.conf

ipup=/usr/local/etc/chilli/up.sh
ipdown=/usr/local/etc/chilli/down.sh
</end>

So I lifted a main.conf from
http://www.geeklan.co.uk/files/coova-main.confand I must swear that I
barely understand it, as the examples seem rather
specific to a certain site. I am including my main.conf and I have decided
to number each life for ease of explaining the lines I don't understand.


<begin main.conf>
#copy this file into /usr/local/chilli
#& create 2 empty files named hs.conf & local.conf
# http://www.geeklan.co.uk/files/coova-main.conf
1. cmdsocket       /var/run/chilli.sock
2. pidfile         /var/run/chilli.pid
3. net             192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
4. uamlisten       192.168.1.101
5. uamport         3990
6. dhcpif          vr0
7. adminuser       chillispot

15. wwwdir                  /usr/local/www/chilli
16. wwwbin                  /usr/local/etc/chilli/wwwsh
17. locationname            "ROWTech Securitet"
18. radiuslocationname      ROWTech_HotSpot
19. radiuslocationid        isocc=,cc=,ac=,network=Coova,
20. radiusserver1           rad01.coova.org
21. radiusserver2           rad01.coova.org
22. radiussecret            coova-anonymous
23. radiusauthport          1812
24. radiusacctport          1813
25. uamserver               https://coova.org/app/uam/chilli
26. radiusnasid             nas01
27.papalwaysok
 </end>

Let's say I have a dual-homed box, with vr0 being the public interface and
fxp0 being the private interface. And say I run a DHCP server on the
internal interface.
Also say I run FreeRADIUS (with MySQL support) on the same box. I also run
my Apache22 on this very box, so it is "everything to me". I have the IP
192.168.1.101 on the internal/private interface (fxp0). Can someone explain
to me what items 6-10, 14, 19, 25 should be?
I am especially not sure how 14 and 25 are being arrived at.

I also have the file named "defaults" which I need to copy to "config". They
are both in /usr/local/etc/chilli/. Looking at them, I see that most of the
parameters are almost like what I see in main.conf. This has left me
confused as what purpose the "config" file is supposed to serve.

All my chilli files are accesible on my webserver via /coova (an Apache
Alias pointer). Now where /app are supposed to come from still beats me.

Am I supposed to be running my own DHCP server or does coova-chilli have
some sort of built-in DHCP server?

At some point, I believe I am going to introduce a Wireless Access Point
into this mix, connected to my DHCP interface, yes? This is how the clients
are going to communicate with the system, correct?

My other problem are two files- up.sh and down,sh: I can run either PF or
IPFilter/IPNat on the FreeBSD box, but not IPTABLES. So I am wondering what
the purpose of these two files. What do they do? I do believe IPTables is
for Linux only. Is there a FreeBSD use who can share their *BSD versions of
these two files?

I also had to install haserl from http://haserl.sourceforge.net/ but I still
wonder if it's necessary in my setup. I still haven't quite caught up speed
on this so please excuse my ignorance.

Thank you so much for your time. Let me not ask too much on this mail:-)

6 is the interface you want chilli to basically listen for dhcp requests on
7 and 8 are radius authentication attibutes, if using that type of auth for
radius
9 is a list of allowed urls surfable without authentication first
10 means it will aloow any dns server, say if a client has one set manually
other then what you rovided from dhcp
14 is for the WISPR login URL
19 is the NAS information for radius
25 is the physical location of the UAM server, should be the same as the
uamhomepage ip or address

the config file is for your customized parameters, where default is the
default coova settings, it reads variables from default, looks at config for
customizations and the writes main.conf, this file is generated by functions

its exactly how i am configured though chilli runs on my APs not on my auth

yes, and no,  if you are running the coova web interface / internal portal
then yes, if not then essentailly no


my config and main.conf for APs looks like

HS_LANIF=ath0              # Subscriber Interface for client devices

my server is on 58.147.26.217 with radius / apache /  uam hostspotlogin, and
notice i do use variables in my config, if you read them it might help you
understand the way it puts this together

RADIUS authentication attributes? The credentials chilli uses to connect to
RADIUS server?

Where is it derived from? I mean, is
/app/uam/auth<https://coova.org/app/uam/auth>derived from some Apache
Alias on my server running the chilli web portal?
What is the actual location on disk?

I still don't understand that one. Why is it in an LDAP like notation?

 Is /app/uam/chilli <https://coova.org/app/uam/chilli> an Apache Alias on
the chilli web portal as well? What is the actual location on disk of the
Alias, if any?

It writes main.conf on the fly??? So I should not create a main.conf?

Wow. So I do not need to have one? Interesting. Thank you for this. It's the
only one I clearly understand now:-)

chilli runs on your APs? You have different computers acting as APs using
Wireless Access Point hardware??

You did not mention anything about the up.sh and down.sh and the issue on
IPTables.... Do you use FreeBSD, bay any chance? It would be most helpful.

I don't understand this answer? Is it optional to run coova web
interface/internal portal? If I don't run them, then what else is there to
run?? <LOL>
Excuse my stupidity on this, honestly.

Hi Guys
The reason I've posted up a dummy main.conf on my site for use with the 
freebsd port is because the conf files bundles with coova as standard 
are intended to be used with init.d which will dynamically generate the 
config files for you through the values defined in /etc/chilli/config, 
this is all well & good but FreeBSD does not use init.d, it uses rcng 
instead.

Subject: coova-connection requests from outer networks..
Message-ID: <42696.139.179.14.250.1227873775.squirrel@webmail.bilkent.edu.tr>

There are some passive devices (network webcams) on my network, which dont
make any traffic normally.
But i normally can reach them from webgui and monitor them.
But after i move them behind chilli,
Even i allow them via macids, they dont appear on the chilli_query list.
And so, if i try to reach that devices from outside, coova can not find
the devices on its list and doesnt allow me to reach them.

But if i connect to the cameras via a proxy i installed behind coova, and
reach the cameras, and ..for example use NTP to reach the outer world,
chilli allows the macid and let me reach it from outside,
but after a while, it looses the macid and the connection again.

So is there a way that i can allow to be authenticated for a static ip
even it is not visible on coova_query list.

Or how can i make the coova arp broadcasts the network behind it, when a
request comes from outer network..
