<h2>"Wow! That's amazing"</h2>
<a href="http://listes.ilesansfil.org/pipermail/wifidog/2006-October/003394.html">FranÃ§ois Proulx</a> of the <a href="http://dev.wifidog.org/">WifiDog project</a> talking about <a href="/CoovaAP">CoovaAP</a> firmware, and later replied, "I am truly pleased to see that someone took the time to create a nice, easy to use package. OpenWRT is now within reach of almost anyone. And I love the fact that Coova integrates a configuration interface for Wifidog."

"This looks really nice.", said <a href="http://wire.less.dk/">Tomas Krag</a>, who is interested in this type of functionality to help make it easier for small ISP's in the developing world to provide simple wi-fi services without requiring too many technical skills.

<strong> Thanks!</strong> That is part of our mission... to make it a whole lot easier to deploy and use Wi-Fi. I hope you let us know where we can improve to make your deployments easier! Also thanks to those who have shared with me their experiences using and developing with open-source Wi-Fi solutions.
