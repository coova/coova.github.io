<a href="/JRadius">JRadius</a> 1.0.0 hasÂ  been released. JRadius is both a <a href="/JRadius/ClientAPI">client</a> and <a href="/JRadius/RunServer">server</a> Java framework for RADIUS. In the server context, it typically runs as a standalone Java server accessed by the standard <a href="http://wiki.freeradius.org/Rlm_jradius">rlm_jradius</a> module in the <a href="http://freeradius.org/">FreeRADIUS</a> server. FreeRADIUS connects to JRadius similarly to how it connects to a SQL server, but this module allows for complete RADIUS logic handling in Java. In the client context, JRadius provides the RADIUS transport layer and an extensive and <a href="/wiki/JRadius_Custom_Dictionary">customizable dictionary</a> of RADIUS attributes - the same attributes used by FreeRADIUS and JRadius servers. Of course, it's not really fair to limit the discussion to just RADIUS anymore as both FreeRADIUS, and now JRadius, support DHCP! That's another blog entry...

The project is now using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">maven</a> exclusively, making it easier to <a href="/wiki/JRadius_Eclipse_Setup">import into Eclipse</a>. Maven is the recommended way to <a href="/wiki/JRadius_Maven">download and develop</a> with JRadius. <a href="/wiki/JRadius_Javadoc">Javadocs</a> are available on-line and for download. As always, bring your problems, questions, and advice to <a href="/forum/">the forum</a> or <a href="/MailingLists">mailing list</a>.
